In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.And God saw the light, that And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry And God called the dry And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, And the earth brought forth grass, And the evening and the morning were the third day.And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.So God created man in his And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.These And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.And the LORD God formed man And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.The name of the first And the gold of that land And the name of the second river And the name of the third river And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.And the LORD God said, And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.And Adam said, This Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:But of the fruit of the tree which And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.And when the woman saw that the tree And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I And he said, Who told thee that thou And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest And the LORD God said unto the woman, What And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.And the LORD said unto Cain, Where And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.And now When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and And his brother’s name And Zillah, she also bare Tubal- cain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.This Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel:And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:And Enoch walked with God: and he And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:And he called his name Noah, saying, This And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare And GOD saw that the wickedness of man And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.These And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.And this A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.And Noah And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.Of clean beasts, and of beasts that There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:All in whose nostrils And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.And God spake unto Noah, saying,Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.Bring forth with thee every living thing that And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him:Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.But flesh with the life thereof, And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man.Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;And with every living creature that And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.And God said, This I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:And I will remember my covenant, which And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that And God said unto Noah, This And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.These And Noah began And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.And he said, Cursed And he said, Blessed God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.Now these The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.These Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazar-maveth, and Jerah,And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.These These And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.And the LORD said, Behold, the people Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.These And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.Now these And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife But Sarai was barren; she And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee:And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This Say, I pray thee, thou And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What Why saidst thou, She And Pharaoh commanded And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.And Abram And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we NoneAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched But the men of Sodom And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.Then Abram removed And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;NoneAll these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.And the vale of Siddim And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he And he blessed him, and said, Blessed And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,That I will not Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.And, behold, the word of the LORD And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.And he said unto him, I And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou And he will be a wild man; his hand And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son’s name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.And Abram And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,As for me, behold, my covenant Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.This And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.And Abraham And Ishmael his son In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set And they said unto him, Where And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard Now Abraham and Sarah Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do And he said And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.But before they lay down, the men of the city, And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as And they said, Stand back. And they said But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.And they smote the men that And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?Said he not unto me, She And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.Now therefore restore the man Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God And yet indeed And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave And Abimelech said, Behold, my land And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.And she went, and sat her down over against And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: And Abraham said, I will swear.And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What And he said, For Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.And And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, And he said, Take now thy son, thine only And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you,And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.And his concubine, whose name And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,I And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,Hear us, my lord: thou And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,My lord, hearken unto me: the land And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current And the field of Ephron, which Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same And the field, and the cave that And Abraham was old, And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.Behold, I stand And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.And the damsel And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten And said, Whose daughter And she said unto him, I She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.And he said, Blessed And the damsel ran, and told And Rebekah had a brother, and his name And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men’s feet that And there was set And he said, I And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house:Then shalt thou be clear from And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go;Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter unto his son.And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.Behold, Rebekah And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave And they did eat and drink, he and the men that And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.For she And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.And these Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.Now these And these And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:These And these And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that And these And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If And the LORD said unto her, Two nations And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.And Esau said, Behold, I And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:And the men of the place asked And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she And Abimelech said, What And Abimelech charged all Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well.Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:And thou shalt bring And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.And his mother said unto him, Upon me And he went, and fetched, and brought And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here And Jacob said unto his father, I And Isaac said unto his son, How And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him.And he said, And he said, Bring And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.And Isaac his father said unto him, Who And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn away;Until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother.And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram;And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.And, behold, I And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,So that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:And this stone, which I have set Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well’s mouth in his place.And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know And he said unto them, And he said, Lo, And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep: for she kept them.And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.And Jacob told Rachel that he And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.And Laban said to him, Surely thou And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder Leah And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.And Laban said, And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him And Jacob said unto Laban, Give And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.And when the LORD saw that Leah And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees that I may also have children by her.And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.And Bilhah Rachel’s maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a son.And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a second son.And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.And she said unto her, And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.And Leah said, God hath endued me And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.Give And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.For And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, And he set three days journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban’s cattle.And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.But when the cattle were feeble, he put And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,And said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle I And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.And now, And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the two maidservants’ tents; but he found Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set This twenty years That which was torn NoneThus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.And Jacob took a stone, and set it up And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.And Laban said, This heap And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold This heap The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.And when Jacob saw them, he said, This And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.And he delivered And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose Then thou shalt say, And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.And he said unto him, What And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.And Jacob asked And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.Therefore the children of Israel eat not And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.And he said, What And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for an hundred pieces of money.And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel.And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.And make ye marriages with us, And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son.And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,These men Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they NoneAnd unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out.The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that So Jacob came to Luz, which And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth.And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and blessed him.And God said unto him, Thy name And God said unto him, I And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel heard The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:And the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, Now these Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;And Bashemath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebajoth.And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau And these These And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau’s son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these And these And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.These Duke Korah, duke Gatam, And these And these These These And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan’s sister And the children of Shobal And these And the children of Anah And these The children of Ezer The children of Dishan These Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these And these And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth And Saul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city And these Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.These Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:For, behold, we And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.And he told And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.And a certain man found him, and, behold, And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.And Reuben heard And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;And they sent the coat of And he knew it, and said, And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which When Judah saw her, he thought her And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she And he said, I will send And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, And Judah said, Let her take And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she When she And Judah acknowledged And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins And it came to pass, when she travailed, that And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.And his master saw that the LORD And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.And it came to pass from the time And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what NoneAnd it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, And it came to pass about this time, that And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing And it came to pass after these things, And Pharaoh was wroth against two And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine And in the vine And Pharaoh’s cup And Joseph said unto him, This Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also And in the uppermost basket And Joseph answered and said, This Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.And it came to pass the third day, And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard’s house, both And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.And And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh The seven good kine And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them This Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.Let Pharaoh do And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti- pherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over And Joseph And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti- pherah priest of On bare unto him.And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.And the sons of Israel came to buy And Joseph And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.We And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.And they said, Thy servants And Joseph said unto them, That Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether And he put them all together into ward three days.And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; If ye But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.And they said one to another, We And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.And they knew not that Joseph understood And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,The man, And we said unto him, We We And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.And the famine And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:But if thou wilt not send And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.And their father Israel said unto them, If And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.And he said, Peace And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which And he asked them of And they answered, Thy servant our father And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.And he took And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.NoneNoneAnd he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.And he said, Now also Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.And he searched, Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he And Joseph said unto them, What deed And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we And he said, God forbid that I should do so: Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.And our father said, Go again, And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.And Joseph said unto his brethren, I And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.For these two years And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.So now Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:And there will I nourish thee; for yet And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred And to his father he sent after this So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,And told him, saying, Joseph And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:And Israel said, And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here And he said, I I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:His sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.And these And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.These And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.These The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him.And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.These And the sons of Dan; Hushim.And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.These All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father’s house, which And the men And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What That ye shall say, Thy servants’ trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they And he took some of his brethren, And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:The land of Egypt And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to And And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh’s.And as for the people, he removed them to cities from Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head.And it came to pass after these things, that And And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who And Joseph said unto his father, They Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this And his father refused, and said, I know And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.Reuben, thou Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; then defiledst thou Simeon and Levi O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.Cursed Judah, thou Judah The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:His eyes Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he Issachar And he saw that rest Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.Out of Asher his bread Naphtali Joseph The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty NoneThe blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.Benjamin shall ravin All these And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that In the cave that There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.The purchase of the field and of the cave that And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for But as for you, ye thought evil against me; Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.Now these Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash And when she had opened Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother.And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew And he said unto his daughters, And where And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.And she bare And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.Moreover he said, I And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.And Moses said unto God, Who And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this And Moses said unto God, Behold, And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.And the LORD said unto him, What And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man’s mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.And Pharaoh said, Who And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.And the taskmasters hasted And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants But he said, Ye Go therefore now, And the officers of the children of Israel did see And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.These And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these And these The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these And Amram took him Jochebed his father’s sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these And Eleazar Aaron’s son took him These These And it came to pass on the day That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, And the Egyptians shall know that I And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.And Moses And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh’s heart Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I And the fish that And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that And the fish that And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.And if thou refuse to let And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, And he said, To morrow. And he said, And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me.And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.For if thou refuse to let Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.And in very deed for this As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.Send therefore now, He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD Intreat the LORD (for And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look Not so: go now ye And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,This month Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.And they shall take of the blood, and strike And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.And thus shall ye eat it; For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.And in the first day And ye shall observe In the first Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?That ye shall say, It And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.It And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This But every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.And it came to pass the selfsame day, And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this This day came ye out in the month Abib.And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD’S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not But God led the people about, And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.And they said unto Moses, Because NoneAnd Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.And the Egyptians shall know that I And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, But the children of Israel walked upon dry Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.The LORD The LORD Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.Who Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people The people shall hear, Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I And they came to Elim, where And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what And Moses said, And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness And when the children of Israel saw This And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.And when they did mete And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.And it came to pass, And he said unto them, This And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, And it came to pass, And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.So the people rested on the seventh day.And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it And Moses said, This And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.Now an omer And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.But Moses’ hands And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi:For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, Then Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her back,And her two sons; of which the name of the one And the name of the other And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.And Jethro said, Blessed Now I know that the LORD And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father in law before God.And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.And God spake all these words, saying,I Thou shalt have no other gods before me.Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain;

And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure And thou shalt beat And Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,And in cutting of stones, to set And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office,And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, It And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which And all the people brake off the golden earrings which And he received And when Aaron saw And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony And the tables And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, And he said, And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break And when Moses saw that the people Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.Therefore now go, lead the people unto And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation And he said, My presence shall go And he said unto him, If thy presence go not For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.And the LORD said, Behold, And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.All that openeth the matrix But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year’s end.Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk.And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses’ hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.And But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ And rams’ skins dyed red, and badgers’ skins, and shittim wood,And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded;The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,The ark, and the staves thereof, The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread,The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle,The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,The cloths of service, to do service in the holy And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD’S offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats’ And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,And in the cutting of stones, to set And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains The length of one curtain And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.And he made curtains The length of one curtain And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.And he made fifty taches And he made a covering for the tent And he made boards for the tabernacle The length of a board One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.And for the other side of the tabernacle, And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.And there were eight boards; and their sockets And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings And he made a vail And he made thereunto four pillars And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets And Bezaleel made the ark And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.And he cast for it four rings of gold, And he made staves And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.And he made the mercy seat And he made two cherubims One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the And the cherubims spread out And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about.Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about;

and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him;

as the LORD commanded Moses.And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.And he set up the hanging And he put the altar of burnt offering And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, If his offering And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:And the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, And if his offering And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, And the remnant of the meat offerings And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, And if thy oblation Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it And if thy oblation And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn And that which is left of the meat offering No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, And if his oblation And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD;

then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock’s head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock’s blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.And the priest shall put And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering;

though he wist And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist It And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour;Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein:Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely;

in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,This In a pan it shall be made with oil; And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water.All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it And no sin offering, whereof Likewise this In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof;

and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.And Moses said unto the congregation, This And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.And he slew And he took all the fat that But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.And he killed And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.And he slew And he brought Aaron’s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that And he put all upon Aaron’s hands, and upon his sons’ hands, and waved them And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt And Moses took the breast, and waved it And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation As he hath done this day, Therefore shall ye abide So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.And it came to pass on the eighth day, And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.And they brought And Moses said, This And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt He slew also the bullock and the ram And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.Then Moses said unto Aaron, This And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and And when Moses heard And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof;

ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day These In the fourteenth And on the fifteenth day of the same month In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.And the meat offering thereof And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first Ye shall do no servile work And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Also on the tenth And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it For whatsoever soul And whatsoever soul Ye shall do no manner of work: It And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month On the first day Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it These Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD.And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, And it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father And the Israelitish woman’s son blasphemed the name And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,And for thy cattle, and for the beast that And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather For it In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.And if thou sell According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.But if he be not able to restore And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.I And if thy brother NoneAnd For they Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:Either his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.If And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, NoneAnd if he be not redeemed in these For unto me the children of Israel Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.I But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of NoneAnd if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies’ land; As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.And upon them that are left And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;And Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I These And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.And if it And if And if And if But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.And if He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.And if And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth And when a man shall sanctify his house And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s.And if Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD’S firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether And if Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; And all the tithe of the land, And if a man will at all redeem And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: thou

the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying,Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father’s house: far off about the tabernacle of

strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office in the sight of Aaron their father.And the LORD spake unto

that cometh nigh shall be put to death.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine;Because all the firstborn And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded.And these

shalt take the Levites for me (I And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel.And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites;Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites:Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after their

camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites:But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their families;From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.This And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers’

fourscore.According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by the hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as the LORD commanded Moses.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead:Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty;Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.And every man’s hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man’s wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman’s head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness But if thou hast gone aside Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar:And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.This Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate He shall separate All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth All the days that he separateth He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God All the days of his separation he And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.And this And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.And the priest shall bring And he shall offer the ram And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put And the priest shall wave them This And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Take And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service:And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar.And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah:And his offering One spoon of

the congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.And this work of the candlestick And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together:And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them For they For all the firstborn of the children of Israel And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel.And I have given the Levites And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,This And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:And those men said unto him, We And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.But the man that And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, So it was alway: the cloud covered it And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.And And Or At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.And if they blow When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I And it came to pass on the twentieth And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.In the first And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over his host And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali Thus And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses’ father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days’ journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days’ journey, to search out a resting place for them.And the cloud of the LORD And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel.And And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.And the mixt multitude that We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:But now our soul And the manna NoneAnd when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.I am not able to bear all this people alone, because And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;NoneAnd Moses said, The people, among whom I Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD’S hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that But there remained two And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD’S people were prophets, And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let And the people stood up all that day, and all And while the flesh And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.NoneAnd Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard (Now the man Moses And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, My servant Moses With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother’s womb.And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men And these Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.These And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this And see the land, what it And what the land And what the land So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this Nevertheless the people The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear And they will tell Now Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,The LORD Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:But Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,How long Say unto them, Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.But And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.Go not up, for the LORD For the Amalekites and the Canaanites But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock:Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth And the fourth Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third And when thou preparest a bullock Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever One ordinance One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations.And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,NoneThen it shall be, if And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, But the soul that doeth Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.I Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, And when Moses heard And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:NoneAnd he hath brought thee near For which cause And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:NoneMoreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that They, and all that And all Israel that And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad NoneBut on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.And it shall come to pass, And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron’s rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.And Moses did And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father’s house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest’s office for every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest’s office And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.This shall be thine of the most holy things, In the most holy And this All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given thee.NoneEvery thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine.All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, And Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the LORD’S heave offering to Aaron the priest.Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,This And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:And And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.And a man And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness This And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.And for an unclean And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip And the clean But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.And whatsoever the unclean Then came the children of Israel, And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.This And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.And the children of Israel, And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor:And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, And And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.And from thence Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:And from Bamoth And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.For Heshbon Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, Behold, And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.And the ass said unto Balaam, Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth.And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon And the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:God Behold, I have received He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.Surely Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river’s side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do And now, behold, I go unto my people: come And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!And ships And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal-peor.And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:And he shall have it, and his seed after him, Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Vex the Midianites, and smite them:For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor’s sake.And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers’ house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan NoneReuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben; Hanoch, Of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites: of Carmi, the family of the Carmites.These And the sons of Pallu; Eliab.And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. This And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign.Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.The sons of Simeon after their families: of Nemuel, the family of the Nemuelites: of Jamin, the family of the Jaminites: of Jachin, the family of the Jachinites:Of Zerah, the family of the Zarhites: of Shaul, the family of the Shaulites.These The children of Gad after their families: of Zephon, the family of the Zephonites: of Haggi, the family of the Haggites: of Shuni, the family of the Shunites:Of Ozni, the family of the Oznites: of Eri, the family of the Erites:Of Arod, the family of the Arodites: of Areli, the family of the Arelites.These The sons of Judah And the sons of Judah after their families were; of Shelah, the family of the Shelanites: of Pharez, the family of the Pharzites: of Zerah, the family of the Zarhites.And the sons of Pharez were; of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites: of Hamul, the family of the Hamulites.These NoneOf Jashub, the family of the Jashubites: of Shimron, the family of the Shimronites.These NoneThese The sons of Joseph after their families Of the sons of Manasseh: of Machir, the family of the Machirites: and Machir begat Gilead: of Gilead These And And And Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons, but daughters: and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad These These And these These The sons of Benjamin after their families: of Bela, the family of the Belaites: of Ashbel, the family of the Ashbelites: of Ahiram, the family of the Ahiramites:Of Shupham, the family of the Shuphamites: of Hupham, the family of the Huphamites.And the sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman: These These All the families of the Shuhamites, according to those that were numbered of them, NoneOf the sons of Beriah: of Heber, the family of the Heberites: of Malchiel, the family of the Malchielites.And the name of the daughter of Asher These NoneOf Jezer, the family of the Jezerites: of Shillem, the family of the Shillemites.These These And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance: to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him.Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided between many and few.And these These And the name of Amram’s wife And unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before the LORD.And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.These But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father’s brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father’s brethren.And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;And a tenth NoneAnd the drink offering thereof And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour NoneAnd in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD;

ye shall do no servile work.Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD, after your weeks But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year;And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs;NoneYe shall offer And in the seventh month, on the first And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD;

he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;And her husband heard But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;And her husband heard But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard These And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; And the children of Israel took And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify And purify all And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Take the sum of the prey that was taken, And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, Take And of the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.And the booty, And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,And threescore and one thousand asses,And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.And the half, And the LORD’S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.And the beeves And the asses And the persons And Moses gave the tribute, And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,(Now the half And thirty and six thousand beeves,And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,And sixteen thousand persons;)Even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one portion of fifty, And the officers which And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.(And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,NoneWherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.And the LORD’S anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying,Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.And the LORD’S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers’ stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war,And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith.So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan And Moses gave unto them, And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,And Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havoth-jair.And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.These And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD: and these And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.For the Egyptians buried all And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth.And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pi-hahiroth, which And they departed from before Pi-hahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days’ journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin.And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink.And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness of Sinai.And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at Kibroth-hattaavah.And they departed from Kibroth-hattaavah, and encamped at Hazeroth.And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmon-parez.And they departed from Rimmon-parez, and pitched in Libnah.And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah.And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah.And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher.And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Bene-jaakan.And they removed from Bene-jaakan, and encamped at Hor-hagidgad.And they went from Hor-hagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah.And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Ezion-gaber.And they removed from Ezion-gaber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin, which And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first And Aaron And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah.And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon.And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth.And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ije-abarim, in the border of Moab.And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibon-gad.And they removed from Dibon-gad, and encamped in Almon-diblathaim.And they removed from Almon-diblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan And they pitched by Jordan, from Beth- jesimoth And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:And ye shall dispossess And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them Moreover it shall come to pass, And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea, and shall go on to Hazar-addar, and pass on to Azmon:And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.And And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor:From mount Hor ye shall point out And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar- enan: this shall be your north border.And ye shall point out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham:And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,These And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance.And the names of the men And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli.The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan.And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.These And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits and the city And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites NoneAnd the cities which ye shall give And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge.Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, These six cities shall be a refuge, And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.Or The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait,Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.So these Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.And if they be married to any of the sons of the And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.Neither shall the inheritance remove from Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father’s brothers’ sons:NoneThese (And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.and the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.NoneMoreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.But Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.And the LORD spake unto me, saying,Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.And command thou the people, saying, Ye Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a footbreadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.Now rise up, And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,That the LORD spake unto me, saying,Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:And (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.From Aroer, which Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.All these cities And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that (All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead And this land, And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan- havoth-jair, unto this day.And I gave Gilead unto Machir.And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.So we abode in the valley over against Beth- peor.Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.Keep therefore and do For what nation And what nation Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons’ sons;NoneAnd ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day Lest ye corrupt The likeness of any beast that The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, For the LORD thy God When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, (For the LORD thy God For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and Did Or hath God assayed to go Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou Know therefore this day, and consider Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:NoneAnd this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:These On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which From Aroer, which And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,I Thou shalt have none other gods before me.Thou shalt not make thee Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:But the seventh day And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.Thou shalt not kill.Neither shalt thou commit adultery.Neither shalt thou steal.Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour’s wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour’s house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.For who Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and Now these That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,And houses full of all good NoneThou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which (For the LORD thy God Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.And thou shalt do To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.NoneThen thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.For thou The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations Thou shalt not be afraid of them: The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:Lest And Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God.Hear, O Israel: Thou A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou Remember, Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.Yet they At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.And I made an ark And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his stead.From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.For the LORD your God He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.He Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.And know ye this day: for And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place;And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;And that ye may prolong For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, But the land, whither ye go to possess it, A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,That I will give And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;And Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.There shall no man be able to stand before you: Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.NoneFor ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.These Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.Ye shall not do after all For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you.But Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest:But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which NoneThou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.If thou shalt hear NoneThen shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do Ye for thou Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.These The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.These ye shall eat of all that And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it NoneBut these And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,And every raven after his kind,And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.And every creeping thing that flieth NoneYe shall not eat Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year.And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; Then shalt thou turn And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household,And the Levite that At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which At the end of And this Of a foreigner thou mayest exact Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations,but they shall not reign over thee.If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.NoneAnd when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty:Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day.And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee;Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.Thou shalt eat And if there be Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee:But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.And thou shalt roast and eat Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks from And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:Every man Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.Neither shalt thou set thee up Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant,And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;And it be told thee, and thou hast heard Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put the evil away from among you.If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment:And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee:According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee, And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that Thou shalt in any wise set But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, The priests the Levites, Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD And this shall be the priest’s due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether The firstfruit For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall choose;Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.There shall not be found among you Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.For all that do these things Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.And the LORD said unto me, They have well I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.And it shall come to pass, But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.And this As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers;If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three:That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities:Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour’s landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him Then both the men, between whom the controversy And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.And thine eye shall not pity; When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;For the LORD your God And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man And what man And what man And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee But thou shalt utterly destroy them; That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God.When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field Only the trees which thou knowest that they If Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which And it shall be, And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer’s neck there in the valley:And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be And all the elders of that city, And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel’s charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.So shalt thou put away the When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive,And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged Thou shalt not see the brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother.And if thy brother In like manner shalt thou do with his ass;

and let And this And of Levi he said, Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.NoneAnd of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD And for the precious fruits And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and His glory And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck And of Gad he said, Blessed And he provided the first part for himself, because there, And of Dan he said, Dan And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south.And of Asher he said, Thy shoes NoneThe eternal God Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob Happy And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.And the LORD said unto him, This So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.And Moses And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying,Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.Whosoever And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they And it came to pass But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that And as soon as we had heard Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father’s house, and give me a true token:And And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.And the men said unto her, We Behold, And it shall be, And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.And she said, According unto your words, so And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)That the waters which came down from above stood And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:That this may be a sign among you, Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.And this Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people And their children, And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, And he said, Nay; but And the captain of the LORD’S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, And ye shall compass the city, all And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD.And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.And the city shall be accursed, And ye, in any wise keep But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, So the people shouted when And they utterly destroyed all that But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.And the young men that were spies went in, and brought Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.And they burnt the city with fire, and all that And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel And Joshua adjured So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, And it shall be, So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, And I, and all the people that (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.And all the people, And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.And when they had set the people, And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.And all the people that And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.And For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.And it came to pass, when all the kings which That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?And they said unto Joshua, We And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We This our bread we took hot And these bottles of wine, which we filled, And the men took of their victuals, and asked not And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We Now therefore ye And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.And now, behold, we And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;That they feared greatly, because Gibeon Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:And stay ye not, And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard And to the kings that NoneAnd they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.And they smote all the souls that And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, But And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;NoneJoshua made war a long time with all those kings.There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.Now these Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, And the coast of Og king of Bashan, And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it And these In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;The king of Jarmuth, one;

the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben And their coast was from Aroer, that Heshbon, and all her cities that And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zareth-shahar in the mount of the valley,And Beth- peor, and Ashdoth-pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border And Moses gave And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that And from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;And in the valley, Beth-aram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and This And Moses gave And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, These But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not And these By lot For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh-barnea.Forty years old Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children’s for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while As yet I Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.And the name of Hebron before NoneAnd their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:And it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:NoneAnd the east border And the border went up to Beth-hogla, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah;

and the goings out of the border were at the sea.And the west border And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.And it came to pass, as she came Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.This And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,And Hazar-gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth-palet,And Hazar-shual, and Beer- sheba, and Bizjothjah,Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities NoneAnd Zanoah, and En- gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages:Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdal-gad,And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,And Gederoth, Beth-dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages:Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages:Ekron, with her towns and her villages:From Ekron even unto the sea, all that Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,And Dannah, and Kirjath-sannah, which And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages:Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,And Janum, and Beth-tappuah, and Aphekah,And Humtah, and Kirjath-arba, which Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:Halhul, Beth-zur, and Gedor,And Maarath, and Beth-anoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages:Kirjath- baal, which In the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah,And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and En-gedi; six cities with their villages.As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth,And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gezer: and the goings out thereof are at the sea.So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea.

Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh’s sons had the land of Gilead.And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that NoneAnd the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim Southward And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out.And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me And Joshua answered them, If thou And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, But the mountain shall be thine; for it And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there.

and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents.Now to the And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.And when the children of Israel heard And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass NoneBut that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;And if we have not For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:But Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old And Joshua called for all Israel, And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the names of their gods, nor cause to swear But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day.For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God.Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out And, behold, this day I Therefore it shall come to pass, When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;For the LORD our God, he And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.And Joshua said unto the people, Ye Now therefore put away, And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.And it came to pass, when she came And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which Neither did Manasseh drive out And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries unto them.And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.And the coast of the Amorites And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.Now these Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;NoneAnd they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushan- rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan- rishathaim.And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.But he himself turned again from the quarries that And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.Now Heber the Kenite, And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.The mountains melted from before the LORD, In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.NoneThey chose new gods; then My heart Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.NoneAwake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.Out of Ephraim And the princes of Issachar Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.Zebulun and Naphtali The kings came They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.He asked water, She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,Have they not sped? have they So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: And And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites,That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land;And I said unto you, I And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that And when Gideon perceived that he And the LORD said unto him, Peace Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father’s young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abi-ezer was gathered after him.And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.Then Jerubbaal, who And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.And the number of them that lapped, And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels And when Gideon was come, behold, And his fellow answered and said, This And it was And he divided the three hundred men And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that So Gideon, and the hundred men that And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man’s sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath, And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan.And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.And Gideon came to Jordan, And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they And the princes of Succoth said, And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.Now Zebah and Zalmunna And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure.And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men And he said, They And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they And they answered, We will willingly give And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.And his concubine that And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother’s brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, And his mother’s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He And they gave him threescore and ten And he went unto his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that And when they told The trees went forth But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:And ye are risen up against my father’s house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:That the cruelty And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee.Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that And it shall be, And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.Then said Zebul unto him, Where And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people And Abimelech, and the company that And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech’s head, and all to brake his skull.Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havoth-jair unto this day, which And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.And the people Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he And Gilead’s wife bare him sons; and his wife’s sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father’s house; for thou Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father’s house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land?And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.And now While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD’S, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.And she said unto him, My father, And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.And he said, Go. And he sent her away And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her NoneAnd the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.And when I saw that ye delivered Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.She may not eat of any And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.Then his father and his mother said unto him, But his father and his mother knew not that it Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find But if ye cannot declare And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson’s wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house.But Samson’s wife was But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.And when he had set the brands on fire, he Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.NoneAnd he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-lehi.And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?But God clave an hollow place that And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.NoneAnd Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.Now And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.And she fastened And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, That he told her all his heart, and said unto her. There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.And she said, The Philistines But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred And when he had restored the eleven hundred Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.In those days And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to In those days And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.When they And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go.Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.And they went up, and pitched in Kirjath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan unto this day: behold, And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, And these went into Micah’s house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.NoneAnd they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they And they took And And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.And they set them up Micah’s graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.And it came to pass in those days, when And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father’s house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months.And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, And his father in law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel’s father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel’s father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel’s father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel’s father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and NoneAnd his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them And they turned aside thither, to go in And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?And he said unto him, We Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man And the old man said, Peace So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.NoneAnd the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, Behold, But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her lord And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.And the chief of all the people, (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.Behold, ye And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any But now this And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness Now therefore deliver But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.Among all this people And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, And the children of Benjamin said, They And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.Therefore they turned NoneAnd there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.And the children of Israel said, Who And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?And they said, What one For the people were numbered, and, behold, And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.And this And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.And the whole congregation sent And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh- gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?And they said, Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed Then they said, Behold, Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, And the children of Benjamin did so, and took And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.And the name of the man And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother’s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? Turn again, my daughters, go Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:NoneThen she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:And let fall also So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.And she took And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to day And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?And now Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.And he said, Who And he said, Blessed And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou And now it is true that I Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.Also he said, Bring the vail that And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who And she said, These six Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem Now this Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy And Boaz said unto the elders, and Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye And all the people that And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed And he shall be unto thee a restorer of And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he Now these And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:And he had two wives; the name of the one And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.And Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.And she And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.And she said, Oh my lord, For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.NoneTalk no more so exceeding proudly; let The bows of the mighty men NoneThe LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.Now the sons of Eli And the priest’s custom with the people And he struck Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.And Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.But Samuel ministered before the LORD, Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.Nay, my sons; for If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.And thou shalt see an enemy And the man of thine, And this And I will raise me up a faithful priest, And it shall come to pass, And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; And it came to pass at that time, when Eli And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.In that day I will perform against Eli all For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here And he said, What And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.And the man said unto Eli, I And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.And his daughter in law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard And she named the child I-chabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod.When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, And when the men of Ashdod saw that They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about And it was Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.Then said they, What Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh, And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.And the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh, And And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen And these And the golden mice, And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and brought up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD.And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until Then Samuel took a stone, and set So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.And his return And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and And he will take your daughters And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name And he had a son, whose name And the asses of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found NoneAnd he said unto him, Behold now, Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God NoneAnd they answered them, and said, He is; behold, As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; And they went up into the city: Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom And Saul answered and said, And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.And the cook took up the shoulder, and And when they were come down from the high place into the city, And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.NoneThen Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:And they will salute thee, and give thee two After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, And it was And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What And one of the same place answered and said, But who And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To morrow, by Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.And it was And the people said unto Samuel, Who And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons Behold, here I And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man’s hand.And he said unto them, The LORD And Samuel said unto the people, Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.NoneSo Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;And turn ye not aside: for For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,Saul chose him three thousand And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that And all Israel heard say And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.And And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way And another company turned the way Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD’S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’ garrison, The forefront of the one And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down Then said Saul unto the people that And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that And Saul and all the people that Moreover the Hebrews Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Beth-aven.And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed And all And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.For, Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect And Saul said, Cast Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters And the name of Saul’s wife And Kish And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,It repenteth me that I have set up Saul And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed And Samuel said, What And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.And Samuel said, When thou And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.And Samuel said, Hath the LORD For rebellion And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he Then he said, I have sinned: So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD’S anointed But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all And he sent, and brought him in. Now he Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.Let our lord now command thy servants, And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which And Jesse took an ass And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.And it came to pass, when the Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height And And And the staff of his spear And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.Now David And the three eldest sons of Jesse went And David But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.And David said, What have I now done? And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was And the Philistine said unto David, And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.And Saul said to him, Whose son And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house.Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.And the women answered And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD’S battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.And David said unto Saul, Who But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in And Saul commanded his servants, And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son in law: and the days were not expired.Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king’s son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.And Saul saw and knew that the LORD And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David’s enemy continually.Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.But Jonathan Saul’s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.Saul also sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David’s wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.And Michal took an image, and laid And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He And Saul sent the messengers And when the messengers were come in, behold, And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.And he stript off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked If he say thus, Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:But So Jonathan made And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow And And I will shoot three arrows on the side And, behold, I will send a lad, But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows And So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he And it came to pass on the morrow, And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry NoneAnd Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed Now therefore what is under thine hand? give And the priest answered David, and said, And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women So the priest gave him hallowed Now a certain man of the servants of Saul And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.And the servants of Achish said unto him, And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard it, they went down thither to him.And every one And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, That all of you have conspired against me, and Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests that And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father’s house.And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD’S priests.And David said unto Abiathar, I knew Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver Then David and his men, And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David And Jonathan Saul’s son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part And Saul said, Blessed Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men Saul also and his men went to seek And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela- hammahlekoth.And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi.And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily.And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD’S anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not, know thou and see that The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, And he said to David, Thou And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father’s house.And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.And Now the name of the man And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:And thus shall ye say to him that liveth And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give So David’s young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.But the men They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.And it was Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, Now therefore, my lord, And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.And David said to Abigail, Blessed And blessed For in very deed, So David received of her hand And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became And it came to pass about ten days And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife.And she arose, and bowed herself on And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD’S anointed, and be guiltless?David said furthermore, The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD’S anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who And David said to Abner, This thing And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.Then Saul said to David, Blessed And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams nor by Urim, nor by prophets.Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.And he said unto her, What form And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded And she brought Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.Then said the princes of the Philistines, What And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? NoneThen Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master’s servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;And had taken the women captives, that So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.Then David and the people that And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake So David went, he and the six hundred men that But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk And David said unto him, To whom We made an invasion And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.And when he had brought him down, behold, And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any And David took all the flocks and the herds, And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that Then answered all the wicked men and Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part And it was And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, To And to And to And to And to Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchi-shua, Saul’s sons.And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.And when the men of Israel that And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here And he said unto me, Who And he said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD’S anointed?And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, And David said unto him, Thy blood And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!Tell Ye mountains of Gilboa, From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.Saul and Jonathan Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal’s wife the Carmelite.And his men that And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.Ish-bosheth Saul’s son And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.Then Abner looked behind him, and said, And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?And Joab said, So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel.But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s men, And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.And Saul had a concubine, whose name Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul’s son, saying, Deliver And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past Now then do And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.And, Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from When Joab and all the host that Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth And afterward when David heard Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.And David said to Joab, and to all the people that And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?Thy hands And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.And all the people took notice For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?And I And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.And Saul’s son had two men And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)And Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.And they came thither into the midst of the house, For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.David In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.And David took And these Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.Again, David gathered together all And David arose, and went with all the people that And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of And when they came to Nachon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to this day.And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obed-edom, and all his household.And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obed- edom, and all that And it was And David danced before the LORD with all So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul’s daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.And he dealt among all the people, Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!And David said unto Michal, And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?Whereas I have not dwelt in In all Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,And as since the time that I commanded judges And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come. And And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for And what one nation in the earth For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.And now, O Lord GOD, thou Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David’s servants, David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.And David took from him a thousand And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.And David gat And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David’s servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.And Joab the son of Zeruiah And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?And And the king said, And the king said unto him, Where Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master’s son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king’s table; and was lame on both his feet.And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, When they told And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ish-tob twelve thousand men.And when David heard of And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ish-tob, and Maacah, When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.And Joab drew nigh, and the people that And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew And when all the kings And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman And David sent and enquired after the woman. And And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I And David sent to Joab, And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a mess But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,And if so be that the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.The rich But the poor And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.And Nathan said to David, Thou And I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give For thou didst And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.And the elders of his house arose, And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed Then said his servants unto him, What thing And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight whereof And he brought forth the people that And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she But Amnon had a friend, whose name And he said unto him, Why And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him meat.So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded And she took a pan, and poured And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought And when she had brought And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her And she said unto him, Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this And And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal- hazor, which And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous and be valiant.And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.And Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity And the king said, Whosoever saith Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.For we must needs die, and Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.And the king said, To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, Today thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king’s face.But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year’s end that he polled And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king’s face.Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!And it was And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.And David said unto all his servants that And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou Whereas thou camest And Ittai answered the king, and said, And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, The king said also unto Zadok the priest, See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.And David went up by the ascent of And And it came to pass, that Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; And Behold, So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.And when David was a little past the top And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses And the king said, And where Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill’s side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.And the king, and all the people that And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.And Absalom said to Hushai, And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.And again, whom should I serve? Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:And I will come upon him while he And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some And he also Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man’s house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.Then David arose, and all the people that And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man’s son, whose name So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo- debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that And David numbered the people that And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?But howsoever, And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant, and And the king said And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.And the victory that day was And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, Ye And say ye to Amasa, And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which And And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’S anointed?And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king For all And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.Now Barzillai was a very aged man, And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?I Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David’s men with him, over Jordan?And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name So every man of Israel went up from after David, And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.So Amasa went to assemble And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.When they And Joab said to Amasa, But Amasa took no heed to the sword that And one of Joab’s men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask I And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.The matter Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast Now Joab And Adoram And Sheva And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD’S oath that But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, which had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land.Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.And Ishbi-benob, which But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel.And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day And he said, The LORD The God of my rock; in him will I trust: I will call on the LORD, When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;He delivered me from my strong enemy, They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.For all his judgments I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes For thou For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.NoneFor who God He maketh my feet like hinds He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.They looked, but Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.The LORD liveth; and blessed It And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.NoneNow these The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men And Although my house But But the man These And after him He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.And after him But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.And David And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.These He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the Asahel the brother of Joab Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see Notwithstanding the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon,And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father’s house.And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what All And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy Now king David was old Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.And the damsel Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.But me, Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.And the king sware, and said, Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.Then Bath-sheba bowed with And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.And Adonijah and all the guests that And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule:And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.And also thus said the king, Blessed And all the guests that And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.And, behold, Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.And the days that David reigned over Israel Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.Now therefore, And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.For it shall be, And Shimei said unto the king, The saying And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;And king Solomon So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I And thy servant Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.And Solomon awoke; and, behold, Then came there two women, And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid it.And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.And the other woman said, Nay; but the living Then said the king, The one saith, This And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.Then spake the woman whose the living child Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God So king Solomon was king over all Israel.And these Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada And Azariah the son of Nathan And Ahishar And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.And these The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan:The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:Baana the son of Ahilud; The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him Ahinadab the son of Iddo Ahimaaz Baanah the son of Hushai Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:Geber the son of Uri Judah and Israel And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.For he had dominion over all And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: My servants shall bring So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;Beside the chief of Solomon’s officers which And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, The nethermost chamber And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe The door for the middle chamber So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.And And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,NoneAnd I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.So Solomon built the house, and finished it.And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built And the house, that And the cedar of the house within And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.And the oracle in the forepart So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that And within the oracle he made two cherubims And five cubits And the other cherub The height of the one cherub And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.And for the entering of the oracle he made doors The two doors also So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part And the two doors And he carved And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof And And And all the doors and posts And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, And his house where he dwelt All these And the foundation And above And the great court round about And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.He For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.And he made two chapiters NoneAnd he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that And the chapiters that And the chapiters upon the two pillars And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and he called the name thereof Boaz.And upon the top of the pillars And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: And under the brim of it round about It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea And it And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits And the work of the bases And on the borders that And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above And under the borders And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, And And in the top of the base For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.After this Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:The two pillars, and the And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.And Solomon left all the vessels And Solomon made all the vessels that And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy For the cherubims spread forth And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy NoneAnd it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in thick darkness.I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)And he said, Blessed Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:And he said, LORD God of Israel, Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, What prayer and supplication soever be Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.Moreover concerning a stranger, that (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.If they sin against thee, (for NoneAnd Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:For they That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, And it was And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,Blessed The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire which he was pleased to do,That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.NoneThen will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:And at this house, And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king’s house,(And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.And he said, What cities And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.And this NoneAnd Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.NoneTheir children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they These But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and the house that he had built,And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen Happy Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold.Beside And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.And the king made silver And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, Of the nations And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father’s sake: Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the sons of Pharaoh.And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.And God stirred him up And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon’s servant, whose mother’s name And this And the man Jeroboam And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two And Ahijah caught the new garment that And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant’s sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it unto thee, And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.And he said unto them, Depart yet And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s counsel that they gave him;And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither But Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.And this thing became a sin: for the people went And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men’s bones shall be burnt upon thee.And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king’s hand was restored him again, and became as And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.He said unto him, I So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase.And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass.And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself And it was Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it.Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they And the days which Jeroboam reigned And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.And there were also sodomites in the land: And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed And it was Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother’s name Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.Nevertheless for David’s sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:Because David did And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name And Asa did And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.Then Asa took all the silver and the gold NoneSo Ben- hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.And it came to pass, when Baasha heard Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.And it came to pass, when he reigned, Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.And his servant Zimri, captain of half And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people And the people And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died,For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest And Elijah the Tishbite, And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that And it shall be, So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman And as she was going to fetch And she said, And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat NoneAnd it came to pass after these things, And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come into him again.And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou And it came to pass And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And And Ahab called Obadiah, which For it was And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, And he answered him, I And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?NoneAnd now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah And it shall come to pass, Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD’S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah And Elijah said, So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.Now therefore send, So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD Then said Elijah unto the people, I, Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid And he said, Do And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.And it came to pass at Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that And when all the people saw And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do And when he saw But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise And he looked, and, behold, And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; And after the earthquake a fire; And it was And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint And it shall come to pass, Yet I have left So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad,Thy silver and thy gold And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell And it came to pass, when And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and Now the men did diligently observe whether And And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.And it came to pass after these things, And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And And the men of his city, They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth- gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver And Jehoshaphat said, And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth- gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets And Micaiah said, So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;And say, Thus saith the king, Put this And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it And a And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.And Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.Jehoshaphat And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.NoneJehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, And he said unto them, What manner of man And they answered him, Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said And the sons of the prophets that And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, And the sons of the prophets that And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, And Elisha saw He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where And when the sons of the prophets which And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they bring And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!But Jehoshaphat said, And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.And Elisha said, But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.And this is And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side And they said, This And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what And he said, What then And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.And the mother of the child said, And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD.And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast And there came a man from Baal-shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave So he set Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman’s wife.And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord And And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, And it was So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.NoneAnd his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that But he said, And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules’ burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw And he said, All And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid And when he came to the tower, he took But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence And he said unto him, Went not mine heart The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast Therefore said he, Take Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that And he said, Go and spy where he Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?And he answered, Fear not: for they that And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.And Elisha said unto them, This And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite And he answered, Thou shalt not smite And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass’s head was And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, And he called the porters; and they told And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we And one of his servants answered and said, Let They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die.And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.And Hazael said, But what, So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant’s sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.Two and twenty years old And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead:And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;Then take the box of oil, and pour So the young man, And when he came, behold, the captains of the host And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and And they said, Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.Then said Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab’s Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master’s sons Look even out the best and meetest of your master’s sons, and set But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?And he that Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD hath done So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah.And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.And he said unto him that And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.Howbeit And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king’s sons And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah did reign over the land.And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king’s son.And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;And a third part And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.And the captains over the hundreds did according to all And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David’s spears and shields, that And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, And he brought forth the king’s son, and put the crown upon him, and And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king’s house: and there was she slain.And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people that they should be the LORD’S people; between the king also and the people.And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword Seven years old In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name And Jehoash did But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, Let the priests take But it was Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the And the priests consented to receive no But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money And it was And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD,And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD.Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests’.Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, And he did And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, all And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.(And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, And he did And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows.And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow. And he put his hand And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened And he said, Take the arrows. And he took And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.So Hazael king of Syria died; and Ben- hadad his son reigned in his stead.And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name And he did Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up: glory But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth- shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, And he did He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name And he did Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king’s son And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.And he did And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they This Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, And he did NoneAnd Menahem exacted the money of Israel, And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, And he did But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king’s house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, And he did In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name And he did Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD.Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.Twenty years old But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day.So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar.And he brought also the brasen altar, which And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king’s burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king’s entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.And he did Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor For And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.And the children of Israel did secretly And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.And the king of Assyria brought And Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children’s children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also And he did He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor For he clave to the LORD, And the LORD was with him; He smote the Philistines, And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which And at the end of three years they took it: And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.And Hezekiah gave At that time did Hezekiah cut off And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller’s field.And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which And Rab- shakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?Thou sayest, (but Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand But Rab-shakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?Where Who But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard And he sent Eliakim, which And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; Where And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God.Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,And have cast their gods into the fire: for they Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, This Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted By the messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.Hast thou not heard long ago Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.And this And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esar- haddon his son reigned in his stead.In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying,I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.At that time Berodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.Behold, the days come, that all that And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. And he said, And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.Manasseh And he did For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;Because they have done Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.Amon And he did And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.Josiah And he did And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king’s, saying,Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren.And he defiled Topheth, which And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan- melech the chamberlain, which And the altars that And the high places that And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.Moreover the altar that And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that Then he said, What title And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.And all the houses also of the high places that And he slew all the priests of the high places that And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the LORD your God, as Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, Moreover the And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, In his days Pharaoh-nechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s stead.Jehoahaz And he did And Pharaoh-nechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.And Pharaoh- nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give Jehoiakim And he did In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets.Surely at the commandment of the LORD came And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.Jehoiachin And he did At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it.And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, And all the men of might, And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father’s brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.Zedekiah And he did For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.And on the ninth And the city was broken up, and all the men of war And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.And in the fifth month, on the seventh And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great And all the army of the Chaldees, that Now the rest of the people But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land And the pillars of brass that And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.And the firepans, and the bowls, The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.The height of the one pillar And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king’s presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land And Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.And And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life.Adam, Sheth, Enosh,Kenan, Mahalaleel, Jered,Henoch, Methuselah, Lamech,Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.And the sons of Gomer; Ashchenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.The sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabta, and Raamah, and Sabtecha.

for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.And he slew an Egyptian, a man of These Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the Also the valiant men of the armies Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abi-ezer the Antothite,Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite,Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.Now these NoneThe chief And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty;

for the oxen stumbled.And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God So David brought not the ark And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.Now these And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.And Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,And said unto them, Ye For because ye So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;And with them their brethren of the second So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, And Berechiah and Elkanah And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.And David Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.And it came to pass, So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon And he appointed Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.Then on that day David delivered first Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.He Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word NoneAnd hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.And He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,NoneSing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.For great For all the gods of the people Glory and honour Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.Give unto the LORD the glory Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.O give thanks unto the LORD; for And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, Blessed So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required:And Obed- edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,And since the time that I commanded judges And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who And What can David O LORD, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.O LORD, And what one nation in the earth For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David’s servants, And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.Then David put And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David’s servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.And Joab the son Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.Then there went And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.And when David heard And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do So Joab and the people that And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and And he brought out the people that And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother slew him.These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer- sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.And the LORD spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying,Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose theeEither three years’ famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders And David said unto God, Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD.And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of And Ornan said unto David, Take And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.Then David said, This And David commanded to gather together the strangers that And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.And David said, Solomon my son Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel.And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.Moreover Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, NoneNow set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.Of which, twenty and four thousand Moreover four thousand And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, Of the Gershonites The sons of Laadan; the chief The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.

As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.And the time that he reigned over Israel And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim to Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:Wisdom and knowledge Then Solomon came And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate And the house which I build But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.Huram said moreover, Blessed And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father’s,The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in flotes by sea to Joppa; and thou shall carry it up to Jerusalem.And Solomon numbered all the strangers that And he set threescore and ten thousand of them Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where And he began to build in the second Now these And the porch that And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.And he made the most holy house, the length whereof And the weight of the nails And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.And the wings of the cherubims And The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces And he made the vail Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that And he made chains, And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.And under it It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea And the thickness of it He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand,and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set He made also ten tables, and placed Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;NoneAnd four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;One sea, and twelve oxen under it.The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.And Solomon made all the vessels that Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy For the cherubims spread forth And they drew out the staves NoneAnd it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy Also the Levites It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.And he said, Blessed Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart:Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.And in it have I put the ark, wherein And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven,And said, O LORD God of Israel, Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place.Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness NoneThen hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name’s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house;Then hear thou from the heavens, If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.If they sin against thee, (for Yet If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and Then hear thou from the heavens, Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant.Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD’S house.And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king’s house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice.If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.Also he built Beth- horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.NoneNoneBut of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they And these And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.And she said to the king, Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen Happy Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.And the king made And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;Beside And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred And three hundred shields Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.And And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king.And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying,Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.And when all Israel But Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,And Beth-zur, and Shoco, and Adullam,And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.And in every several city And the priests and the Levites that For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest’s office unto the LORD:And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.And it came to pass, With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people And he took the fenced cities which Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him that he would not destroy So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of But as for us, the LORD And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also And, behold, God himself is with us for But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.And Asa did For he took away the altars of the strange And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about And Asa had an army And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.And Asa and the people that And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD Now for a long season Israel But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.And in those times And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.And also But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.And there was no In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,NoneAnd Ben- hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.And it came to pass, when Baasha heard Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;But sought to the Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance.And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, And with them And they taught in Judah, and And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that Also And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store.And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, And these And next to him And next him And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.And next him These waited on the king, beside Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.And after And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver But Jehoshaphat said, And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, And the king of Israel called for one And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets And Micaiah said, And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;And say, Thus saith the king, Put this And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.And a And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD.Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king’s matters: also the Levites It came to pass after this also, Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,And said, O LORD God of our fathers, NoneAnd they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,If, And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;Behold, O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.Ye shall not And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD.And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Ezion-gaber.Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and Jehoram And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father’s house, Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:And thou Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.Forty and two years old He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction.He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.This And a third part But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.Then they brought out the king’s son, and put upon him the crown, and Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king’s house, they slew her there.And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD’S people.Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king’s house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.Joash And Joash did And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.And it came to pass after this, And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.And when they had finished But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon And it came to pass at the end of the year, For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.Now Amaziah And he did Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.But he slew not their children, but Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD But if thou wilt go, do And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.Then Amaziah separated them, And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.And But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to But Amaziah would not hear; for it So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.And And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.Sixteen years old And he did And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Mehunims.And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour And under their hand And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, Then Uzziah was wroth, and And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which Jotham And he did He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.Ahaz For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.And Tilgath- pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.For Ahaz took away a portion And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, Hezekiah began to reign And he did He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street,And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy For our fathers have trespassed, and done Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.Now My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense.Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse Now they began on the first Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled And they brought forth the he goats And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet: for And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, And the consecrated things But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the And also the burnt offerings And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.And they arose and took away the altars that Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, For For a multitude of the people, NoneAnd the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.NoneMoreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all And In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, And next him Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that With him After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of Who Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?And his servants spake yet He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ speech unto the people of Jerusalem that And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, And for this And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.Howbeit in Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.Manasseh But did For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only.Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they His prayer also, and So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.Amon But he did And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.Josiah And he did For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.And And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.And they put Even to the artificers and builders gave they And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them Also And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king’s, saying,Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great And Hilkiah, and And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; And prepare And stand in the holy So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king’s commandment.And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron And the singers the sons of Asaph So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to And his deeds, first and last, behold, they Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s stead in Jerusalem.Jehoahaz And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.Jehoiakim Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they Jehoiachin And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.Zedekiah And he did And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which Who And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all And all they that Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.And this Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second All the vessels of gold and of silver Now these Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah.

But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.Then stood Jeshua And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:Then And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest This Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up Now because we have maintenance from That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city We certify the king that, if this city be builded NoneThe letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter Then ceased the work of the house of God which Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar- boznai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar- boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace.Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.Then asked we those elders, We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that Then came the same Sheshbazzar, Now therefore, if Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein In the first year of Cyrus the king NoneAnd also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, Now Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon;

And I set a great assembly against them.And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us?

And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused And Nehemiah, which Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as So the people went forth, and brought And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, Thou, Thou And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.Nevertheless for thy great mercies’ sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.Howbeit thou Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.Behold, we And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we And because of all this we make a sure Now those that sealed Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,Pashur, Amariah, Malchijah,Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah: these And the Levites: both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;And their brethren, Shebaniah, Hodijah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,Micha, Rehob, Hashabiah,Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,Hodijah, Bani, Beninu.The chief of the people;

And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, For in the days of David and Asaph of old And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded But in all this And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.In those days saw I in Judah There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and In those days also saw I Jews And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people.And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?And Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this NoneIn the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace;NoneAnd they gave And the drinking Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so And the next unto him What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that For NoneIf it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:For he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women unto the custody of Hege the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.NoneWho had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.And he brought up Hadassah, that So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, Then thus came In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate.Esther had not In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that And all the king’s servants, that Then the king’s servants, which Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s matters would stand: for he had told them that he And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that In the first month, that And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.And the king said unto Haman, The silver Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors that And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;And came even before the king’s gate: for none And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told Then called Esther for Hatach, So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews.For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, Then Esther bade Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what And Esther answered, If Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.And the king said, Who And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,Let the royal apparel be brought which the king And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every And while they So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king’s damage.Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?And Esther said, The adversary and enemy And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews’ enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king’s name, and seal Then were the king’s scribes called at that time in the third month, that And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus’ name, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, Wherein the king granted the Jews which Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province NoneAnd Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.Now in the twelfth month, that The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.For Mordecai Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.For the Jews that But the other Jews that On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.But the Jews that Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that To stablish As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that But when Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their And Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, To confirm these days of Purim in their times And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.And his sons went and feasted And it was so, when the days of Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath And there was a day when his sons and his daughters And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:And the Sabeans fell While he While he While he And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.And Job spake, and said,Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.As Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but Because it shut not up the doors of my Why died I not from the womb? Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants There the wicked cease NoneThe small and great are there; and the servant Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter Which long for death, but it Which rejoice exceedingly, NoneFor my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,NoneBehold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.NoneRemember, I pray thee, who Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad.Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:How much less They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding Doth not their excellency Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.Behold, happy For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle Thou shalt know also that thy seed Thou shalt come to Lo this, we have searched it, so it But Job answered and said,O that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.For the arrows of the Almighty Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?

or, Give a reward for me of your substance?Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig Now therefore be content, look upon me; for Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness Is there iniquity in my tongue?

and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.Man He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?Who can bring a clean Seeing his days Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;NoneBut man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where NoneSo man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens Oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!If a man die, shall he live Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?My transgression And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.His sons come to honour, and he knoweth But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.NoneHast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?What knowest thou, that we know not? With us NoneWhy doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest What Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.How much more abominable and filthy I will shew thee, hear me; and that Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.The wicked man travaileth with pain all A dreadful sound He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.He wandereth abroad for bread, Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.He runneth upon him, Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on And he dwelleth in desolate cities, He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.For the congregation of hypocrites They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.Then Job answered and said,I have heard many such things: miserable comforters Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?I also could speak as ye NoneThough I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, He teareth They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.My face is foul with weeping, and my eyelids is the shadow of death;Not for O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.Also now, behold, my witness My friends scorn me: Oh that one might plead for a man with God, as a man When a few years are come, then I shall go the way My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves NoneLay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt He that speaketh flattery to He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members Upright The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find My days are past, my purposes are broken off, They change the night into day: the light If I wait, the grave I have said to corruption, Thou And where They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,How long Wherefore are we counted as beasts, He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.The gin shall take The snare Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction It shall devour the strength of his skin: His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.They that come after Surely such Then Job answered and said,How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed And be it indeed If indeed ye will magnify Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.I called my servant, and he gave My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children’s Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!For I know And Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.Knowest thou That the triumphing of the wicked Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;NoneHe shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.The eye also His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.His bones are full Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, NoneNoneHe hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him.He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow Because he hath oppressed Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.NoneHe shall flee from the iron weapon, It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors All darkness The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.The increase of his house shall depart, This But Job answered and said,Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.As for me, Mark me, and be astonished, and lay Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.Their houses Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.What Lo, their good How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.For what pleasure Shall One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices For ye say, Where Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?NoneWill he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?NoneFor thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.But Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.Therefore snares Or darkness, NoneAnd thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?Thick clouds Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?Yet he filled their houses with good The righteous see Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.When He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.Then Job answered and said,Even to day Oh that I knew where I might find him! I would order I would know the words Will he plead against me with There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.Behold, I go forward, but he On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold But he knoweth the way that I take: My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary But he For he performeth Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:Because I was not cut off before the darkness, Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?NoneThey drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge.They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.Behold, They reap They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.They cause NoneMen groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth In the dark they dig through houses, For the morning He Drought and heat consume the snow waters: The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.He evil entreateth the barren that He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no NoneThey are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all And if Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,Dominion and fear Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.How much less man, But Job answered and said,How hast thou helped How hast thou counseled To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?Dead Hell He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.He holdeth back the face of his throne, He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.Lo, these Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,NoneAll the while my breath My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.For what Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?I will teach you by the hand of God: Behold, all ye yourselves have seen This If his children be multiplied, Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;He may prepare He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.For NoneSurely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; NoneThe stones of it NoneThe lion’s whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and But where shall wisdom be found? and where Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.The depth saith, It It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.Whence then cometh wisdom? and where Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.For he looketh to the ends of the earth, To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,Oh that I were as When his candle shined upon my head, As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God When the Almighty When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;When I went out to the gate through the city, The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, The princes refrained talking, and laid The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.When the ear heard Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment I was eyes to the blind, and feet I And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply My root My glory Unto me After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide NoneI chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one But now Yea, whereto For want and famine Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots They were driven forth from among To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.NoneAnd now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.Upon They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.They came Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.By the great force He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride For I know Howbeit he will not stretch out Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was When I looked for good, then evil came My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.My harp also is I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?For what portion of God NoneDoth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;NoneIf mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or NoneFor this For it If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?If I have withheld the poor from Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;If his loins have not blessed me, and If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:NoneFor destruction If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, If I rejoiced because my wealth If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:This also If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.The stranger did not lodge in the street: If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.When Elihu saw that And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.But Great men are not Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.Now he hath not directed They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, NoneFor I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.Behold, my belly I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.For I know not to give flattering titles; Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.My words The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.If thou canst answer me, set Behold, I Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of I am clean without transgression, I Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.Behold, Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.For God speaketh once, yea twice, In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,That he may withdraw man He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.He looketh upon men, and He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.Lo, all these To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.Furthermore Elihu answered and said,Hear my words, O ye wise For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.Should I lie against my right? my wound What man Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?If he set his heart upon man, All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.If now Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?NoneNoneIn a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.For his eyes NoneFor he will not lay upon man more He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne NoneNoneLet men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words My desire For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth Elihu spake moreover, and said,Thinkest thou this to be right, For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?Thy wickedness By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make But none saith, Where Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, But now, because Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.Elihu also proceeded, and said,Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.For truly my words Behold, God He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings And if Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.If they obey and serve But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.They die in youth, and their life He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold Because Will he esteem thy riches? Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.Every man may see it; man may behold Behold, God For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:Which the clouds do drop Also can Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.For he saith to the snow, Be thou He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?How thy garments Hast thou with him spread out the sky, Teach us what we shall say unto him; Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.And now Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.NoneMen do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,Who Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?Or When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,And brake up for it my decreed And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?It is turned as clay And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.Where That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths Knowest thou Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?By what way is the light parted, Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;To cause it to rain on the earth, To satisfy the desolate and waste Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?The waters are hid as Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,When they couch in Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? Canst thou number the months They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.The range of the mountains Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?Wilt thou trust him, because his strength Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather NoneWhich leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.She is hardened against her young ones, as though Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.Hath thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.From thence she seeketh the prey, Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct Then Job answered the LORD, and said,Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?Deck thyself now Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one Look on every one Hide them in the dust together; Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.Lo now, his strength He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.His bones He Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.The shady trees cover him Behold, he drinketh up a river, He taketh it with his eyes: Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?Wilt thou play with him as Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not None Who hath prevented me, that I should repay I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.Who can discover the face of his garment? Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth NoneOne is so near to another, that no air can come between them.They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes Out of his mouth go burning lamps, Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.He esteemeth iron as straw, The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.Sharp stones He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.He maketh a path to shine after him; Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.He beholdeth all high Then Job answered the LORD, and said,I know that thou canst do every Who Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.Wherefore I abhor And it was Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.He had also seven sons and three daughters.And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.And in all the land were no women found After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, Blessed But his delight And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. The ungodly Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.     Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?  The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou Ask of me, and I shall give Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel. Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many Many But thou, O LORD, I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah. I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies Salvation Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me O ye sons of men, how long But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him. Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. NoneThou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.    Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation. Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray. My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct For thou The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. But as for me, I will come Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face. For Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee. But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long? Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake. For in death I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies. Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping. The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer. Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me: Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:) Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high. The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. My defence God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors. Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate. I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.    O LORD our Lord, how excellent Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!    I will praise I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence. For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right. Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them. But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness. The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings. When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation. The heathen are sunk down in the pit The LORD is known The wicked shall be turned into hell, For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight. Put them in fear, O LORD: Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? The wicked in For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the covetous, The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek His ways are always grievous; thy judgments He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. He croucheth, He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble. Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require Thou hast seen Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil The LORD LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.    In the LORD put I my trust: How say ye to my soul, Flee For, lo, the wicked bend If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? The LORD The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.    Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set The words of the LORD Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.    How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Consider Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.    The fool hath said in his heart, The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, They are all gone aside, they are Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people There were they in great fear: for God Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD Oh that the salvation of Israel LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. NoneIn whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. NonePreserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. NoneNoneTheir sorrows shall be multiplied The LORD The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons. I have set the LORD always before me: because Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal. Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept Hold up my goings in thy paths, I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings, From the wicked that oppress me, They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; Like as a lion Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, From men As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.    I will love thee, O LORD, my strength. The LORD I will call upon the LORD, The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me. In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth. There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him At the brightness The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them. Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters. He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me. They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me. The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. For all his judgments I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity. Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright; With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward. For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks. For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness. For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. NoneFor who NoneHe maketh my feet like hinds’ He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great. Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip. I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed. I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet. For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me. They cried, but Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets. Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me. The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places. The LORD liveth; and blessed NoneHe delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name. Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.    The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. NoneTheir line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, Which His going forth The law of the LORD The statutes of the LORD The fear of the LORD More to be desired Moreover by them is thy servant warned: Who can understand Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.    The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee; Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion; Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah. Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel. We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand. Some They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright. Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.    The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! Thou hast given him his heart’s desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah. For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head. He asked life of thee, His glory For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance. For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved. Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent. But thou Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them. They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded. But I All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head He trusted on the LORD But thou I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou Be not far from me; for trouble Many bulls have compassed me: strong They gaped upon me I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet. I may tell all my bones: they look They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me. Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog. Save me from the lion’s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns. I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee. Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel. For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard. My praise The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever. All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. For the kingdom All A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation. They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done The LORD He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.    The earth For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. This Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul. O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me. Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause. Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths. Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness’ sake, O LORD. Good and upright The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way. All the paths of the LORD For thy name’s sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it What man His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth. The secret of the LORD Mine eyes Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I The troubles of my heart are enlarged: Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins. Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred. O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee. Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee. Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.    Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. For thy lovingkindness I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. I have hated the congregation of evildoers; and will not sit with the wicked. I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD: That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works. LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: In whose hands But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me. My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.    The LORD When the wicked, Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this One For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD. Hear, O LORD, NoneHide not thy face When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up. Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies. Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. NoneWait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.    Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle. Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert. Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up. Blessed The LORD The LORD Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.    Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength. Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. The voice of the LORD The voice of the LORD The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn. The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire. The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever. The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.    I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me. O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. For his anger And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved. LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication. What profit Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper. Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness; To the end that In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness. Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me. For thou Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth. I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD. I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities; And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room. Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed. I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me. I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel. For I have heard the slander of many: fear But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou My times Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies’ sake. Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous. NoneThou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. Blessed For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee. O love the LORD, all ye his saints: Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.    Blessed Blessed When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah. I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him. Thou I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the horse, Many sorrows Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. For the word of the LORD He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD. By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. For he spake, and it was The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect. The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. Blessed The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth. He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works. There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. An horse Behold, the eye of the LORD To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.    I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed. This poor man cried, and the LORD heard The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. O taste and see that the LORD O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD. What man Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. The eyes of the LORD The face of the LORD NoneThe LORD Many He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken. Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate. The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.    Plead Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help. Draw out also the spear, and stop Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt. Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them. For without cause have they hid for me their net Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall. And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation. All my bones shall say, LORD, who False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge They rewarded me evil for good But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing I behaved myself as though But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth. Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions. I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people. Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, NoneStir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me. Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up. Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful. The words of his mouth He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way Thy mercy, O LORD, Thy righteousness How excellent They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me. There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.    Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. Trust in the LORD, and do good; Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday. Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming. The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken. A little that a righteous man hath For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous. The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth. For The steps of a Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth I have been young, and NoneDepart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore. For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever. The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment. The law of his God The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him. The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree. Yet he passed away, and, lo, he Mark the perfect But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off. But the salvation of the righteous And the LORD shall help them and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.    O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore. NoneFor mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. My wounds stink I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. For my loins are filled with a loathsome I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. Lord, all my desire My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off. They also that seek after my life lay snares But I, as a deaf Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. For I said, For I For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. But mine enemies They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me. Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.    I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it Behold, thou hast made my days Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish. I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand. When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.    I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, And he hath put a new song in my mouth, Blessed Many, O LORD my God, Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest. I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation. Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me. For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me. Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me. Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil. Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha. Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified. But I Blessed The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness. I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish? And if he come to see All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt. An evil disease, Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them. By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever. Blessed As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where When I remember these Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar. Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. NoneI will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? NoneWhy art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man. For thou O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles. Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God. Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, NoneFor they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them. Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob. Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us. In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah. But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies. Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves. Thou hast given us like sheep Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us. Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people. My confusion For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger. All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death. If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god; Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast Wherefore hidest thou thy face, For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth. Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies’ sake.    My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. Gird thy sword upon And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness Thine arrows Thy throne, O God, Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. All thy garments Kings’ daughters Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house; So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he And the daughter of Tyre The king’s daughter She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king’s palace. Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth. I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.    God Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; NoneNoneGod The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted. The LORD of hosts Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. Be still, and know that I The LORD of hosts O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. For the LORD most high He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet. Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises. For God God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness. The princes of the people are gathered together, Great Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, God is known in her palaces for a refuge. For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together. They saw Fear took hold upon them there, Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind. As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah. We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple. According to thy name, O God, so Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof. Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell For this God Hear this, all Both low and high, rich and poor, together. My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; None (For the redemption of their soul That he should still live for ever, For he seeth Their inward thought Nevertheless man This their way Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah. Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased; For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him. Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light. Man The mighty God, Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people. Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, I will take no bullock out of thy house, For every beast of the forest I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High: And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee. When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. Thou sittest These Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Make me to hear joy and gladness; Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me NoneDeliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise. For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give The sacrifices of God Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem. Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.    Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp rasor, working deceitfully. Thou lovest evil more than good; Thou lovest all devouring words, O God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him: Lo, But I I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done The fool hath said in his heart, God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people There were they in great fear, Oh that the salvation of Israel Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength. Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. Behold, God He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth. I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication. Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise; Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! Lo, I would hasten my escape from the windy storm Destroy, O Lord, Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow Wickedness For But We took sweet counsel together, Let death seize upon them, As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me. Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice. He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. NoneCast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.    Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me. Mine enemies would daily swallow What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul. Shall they escape by iniquity? in Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: When I cry In God will I praise In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me. Thy vows For thou hast delivered my soul from death: Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth He shall send from heaven, and save My soul Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise. Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations. For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds. Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth. The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. Their poison Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely. Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD. Let them melt away as waters As a snail Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. So that a man shall say, Verily Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me. Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men. For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not They run and prepare themselves without Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah. They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision. NoneThe God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield. NoneConsume And at evening let them return; Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied. But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble. Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again. Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment. Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. That thy beloved may be delivered; save God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. Gilead Moab Who will bring me NoneGive us help from trouble: for vain Through God we shall do valiantly: for he Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock For thou hast been a shelter for me, I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah. For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given Thou wilt prolong the king’s life: He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.    Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him He only How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall They only consult to cast My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation He only In God Trust in him at all times; Surely men of low degree Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power Also unto thee, O Lord, O God, thou To see thy power and thy glory, so Because thy lovingkindness Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name. My soul shall be satisfied as When I remember thee upon my bed, Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me. But those They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes. But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.    Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy. Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity: Who whet their tongue like a sword, That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. They encourage themselves They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward But God shall shoot at them So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away. And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing. The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.    Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed. O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come. Iniquities prevail against me: Blessed By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people. They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof. Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness. They drop The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.    Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands: Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious. Say unto God, How terrible All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing Come and see the works of God: He turned the sea into dry He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah. O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard: Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved. For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried. Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins. Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows, Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble. I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah. Come I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue. If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear NoneBlessed God be merciful unto us, and bless us; That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations. Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah. Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. NoneGod shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.    Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him. As smoke is driven away, But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice. Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah: The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary. Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor. The Lord gave the word: great Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil. Though ye have lien among the pots, When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was The hill of God Why leap ye, ye high hills? The chariots of God Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, Blessed NoneBut God shall wound the head of his enemies, The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of They have seen thy goings, O God; The singers went before, the players on instruments Bless ye God in the congregations, There Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us. Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee. Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God. Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah: To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency O God, Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto I sink in deep mire, where I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee. Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel. Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face. I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children. For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me. When I wept, I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them. They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I But as for me, my prayer Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily. Draw nigh unto my soul, Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. Let their table become a snare before them: and Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake. Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. Let their habitation be desolate; For they persecute Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness. Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous. But I I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. NoneThe humble shall see For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners. Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein. For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession. The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.    NoneLet them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha. Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. But I In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion. Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me. Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. For thou By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother’s bowels: my praise I am as a wonder unto many; but thou Let my mouth be filled Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth. For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together, Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help. Let them be confounded But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more. My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works. Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto Thy righteousness also, O God, NoneThou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side. I will also praise thee with the psaltery, My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed. My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.    Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king’s son. He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment. The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness. He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations. He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth. He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him. For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy. He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight. And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and Blessed And blessed The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.  Book III   Truly God But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. For I was envious at the foolish, For They Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish. They are corrupt, and speak wickedly They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High? Behold, these Verily I have cleansed my heart For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning. If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend When I thought to know this, it Until I went into the sanctuary of God; Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction. How are they As a dream when Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins. So foolish Nevertheless I Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me Whom have I in heaven My flesh and my heart faileth: For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee. But O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? Remember thy congregation, Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns NoneBut now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers. They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. We see not our signs: O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck For God Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers. The day Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. Remember this, O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name. Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily. Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.    Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly. The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah. I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: Lift not up your horn on high: speak For promotion But God For in the hand of the LORD But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; In Judah In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah. Thou The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands. At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. Thou, Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah. Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. He shall cut off the spirit of princes: I cried unto God with my voice, In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search. Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah. And I said, This I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. Thy way, O God, Thou Thou hast with The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled. The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. The voice of thy thunder Thy way Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.    Give ear, O my people, I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. We will not hide For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: That the generation to come might know That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation The children of Ephraim, They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness. And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? Therefore the LORD heard Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full. He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: And he let So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. And they remembered that God Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. But he, For he remembered that they How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. They remembered not his hand, How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. When God heard So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand. He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. And he built his sanctuary like high He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.    O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. The dead bodies of thy servants have they given Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire? Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name. For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place. O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake. Wherefore should the heathen say, Where Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die; And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord. So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.    Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure. Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves. Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. Thou preparedst The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river. Why hast thou The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it. Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine; And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch NoneLet thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.    Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery. Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day. For this This he ordained in Joseph I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots. Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah. Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me; There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god. I But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me. So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lust: Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries. The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever. He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.    God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy: rid They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. I have said, Ye But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.    Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee: The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah. Do unto them as NoneMake their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna: Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession. O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind. As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: That How amiable My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, Blessed Blessed NoneThey go from strength to strength, O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed. For a day in thy courts For the LORD God O LORD of hosts, blessed LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah. Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease. Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations? Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee? Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation. I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly. Surely his salvation Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. Yea, the LORD shall give Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I Preserve my soul; for I Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily. Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. For thou, Lord, Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me. Among the gods All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name. For thou Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore. For great O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent But thou, O Lord, O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid. Show me a token for good; that they which hate me may see His foundation The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this And of Zion it shall be said, This and The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah. As well the singers as the players on instruments O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry; For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave. I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand. Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps. Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee. Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee. LORD, why castest thou off my soul? I Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off. They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together. Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens. I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah. And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all O LORD God of hosts, who Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them. Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm. The heavens The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name. Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, Justice and judgment Blessed In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted. For thou For the LORD Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him: With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him. The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him. And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him. But my faithfulness and my mercy I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. He shall cry unto me, Thou Also I will make him My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him. His seed also will I make If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David. His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. It shall be established for ever as the moon, and But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed. Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin. All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours. Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle. Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground. The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah. How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire? Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain? What man Lord, where Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed. Blessed LORD, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men. For a thousand years in thy sight Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled. Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale The days of our years Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, So teach Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants. O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. Make us glad according to the days Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children. And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.    He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the LORD, Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; NoneA thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. Because thou hast made the LORD, There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.    NoneTo shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound. For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands. O LORD, how great are thy works! A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this. When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; But thou, LORD, For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. But my horn shalt thou exalt like Mine eye also shall see The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing; To shew that the LORD The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, Thy throne The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.  The LORD on high Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.    O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself. Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud. LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph? NoneThey break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage. They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard Understand, ye brutish among the people: and He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they Blessed That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked. For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it. Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? Unless the LORD When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up. In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul. Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law? They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. But the LORD is my defence; and my God And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. For the LORD In his hand The sea O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker. For he Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. Forty years long was I grieved with Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.    O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth. Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day. Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people. For the LORD For all the gods of the nations Honour and majesty Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength. Give unto the LORD the glory O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth. Say among the heathen Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. Let the field be joyful, and all that Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.    The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad Clouds and darkness A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled. The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory. Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD. For thou, LORD, Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.    O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory. The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen. He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm. With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King. Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. Let the floods clap Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.    The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth The LORD Let them praise thy great and terrible name; The king’s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them. He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands. Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing. Know ye that the LORD he Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, For the LORD I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing. I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. Mine eyes He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.    Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee. Hide not thy face from me in the day For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth. My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread. By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin. I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert. I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. Mine enemies reproach me all the day; For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping, Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. My days But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations. Thou shalt arise, For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof. So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory. When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD. For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth; To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death; To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: But thou The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.    Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; Who satisfieth thy mouth with good The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. The LORD He will not always chide: neither will he keep He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the earth, As far as the east is from the west, Like as a father pitieth For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we NoneFor the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. But the mercy of the LORD To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them. The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. Bless ye the LORD, all Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.    Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. Who coverest Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: NoneThou coveredst it with the deep as At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them. Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. He sendeth the springs into the valleys, They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst. By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; And wine The trees of the LORD are full Where the birds make their nests: The high hills He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens. Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening. O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. NoneThere go the ships: These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give NoneThou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth. The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works. He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke. I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD. Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.    O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people. Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works. Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore. Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. He He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word Which And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: When they were When they went from one nation to another, from He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; NoneMoreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread. He sent a man before them, Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him. The king sent and loosed him; He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom. Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. He sent Moses his servant; They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word. He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings. He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, He gave them hail for rain, He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number, And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them. He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. NoneHe opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places For he remembered his holy promise, And he brought forth his people with joy, And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people; That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.    Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? Blessed Remember me, O LORD, with the favour That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. And he saved them from the hand of him that hated And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. They envied Moses also in the camp, The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; Wondrous works in the land of Ham, Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: But murmured in their tents, Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. Thus they provoked Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. They angered Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them: But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, And shed innocent blood, Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them. Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry: And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives. Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, Blessed O give thanks unto the LORD, for Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. Oh that For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High: Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. Oh that For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered Oh that And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit’s end. Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. Oh that Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground; A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings. And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease. Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh The righteous shall see Whoso O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. Awake, psaltery and harp: I I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. For thy mercy Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth; That thy beloved may be delivered: save God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. Gilead Moab Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? NoneGive us help from trouble: for vain Through God we shall do valiantly: for he Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. For my love they are my adversaries: but I And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand. When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin. Let his days be few; Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour. Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children. Let his posterity be cut off; Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart. As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him. As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. Let it be unto him as the garment NoneBut do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name’s sake: because thy mercy For I I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness. I became also a reproach unto them: Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy: That they may know that this Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice. Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude. For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. Thy people The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.    Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with The works of the LORD His work He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant. He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen. The works of his hands They stand fast for ever and ever, He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend The fear of the LORD Praise ye the LORD. Blessed His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed. Wealth and riches Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion. Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD. His heart He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour. The wicked shall see Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD’S name The LORD Who Who humbleth He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, That he may set He maketh the barren woman to keep house, When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; Judah was his sanctuary, The sea saw The mountains skipped like rams, What Ye mountains, Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; Which turned the rock Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, Wherefore should the heathen say, Where But our God Their idols They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not: They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not: They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat. They that make them are like unto them; O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless He will bless them that fear the LORD, The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children. Ye The heaven, The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence. But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.    I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. Gracious The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me. Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee. For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: I said in my haste, All men What shall I render unto the LORD I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD. I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people. Precious in the sight of the LORD O LORD, truly I I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD. I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people, In the courts of the LORD’S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.    O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people. For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD O give thanks unto the LORD; for Let Israel now say, that his mercy Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, The LORD The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see NoneNoneAll nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them. They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me. The LORD The voice of rejoicing and salvation The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD. The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter. I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation. The stone This is the LORD’S doing; it This Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity. Blessed God Thou O give thanks unto the LORD; for Blessed Blessed They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways. Thou hast commanded O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes! Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments. I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments. I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.  BETH.  Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments. Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. Blessed With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth. I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways. I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.  GIMEL.  Deal bountifully with thy servant, Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. I My soul breaketh for the longing Thou hast rebuked the proud Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies. Princes also did sit Thy testimonies also My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word. I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes. Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works. My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word. Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously. I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame. I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.  HE.  Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight. Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness. Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.  VAU.  Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word. And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments. So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever. And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts. I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed. And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved. My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.  ZAIN  Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope. This The proud have had me greatly in derision: I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself. Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law. Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law. This I had, because I kept thy precepts.  CHETH.  NoneI intreated thy favour with I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments. The bands of the wicked have robbed me: At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments. I The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.  TETH.  Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word. Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments. Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word. Thou The proud have forged a lie against me: Their heart is as fat as grease; NoneThe law of thy mouth Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments. They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word. I know, O LORD, that thy judgments Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant. Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies. Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.  CAPH.  My soul fainteth for thy salvation: Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me? For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; How many The proud have digged pits for me, which All thy commandments They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts. Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.  LAMED.  For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven. Thy faithfulness They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all Unless thy law I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me. I The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: I have seen an end of all perfection: O how love I thy law! it Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts. I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word. I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me. How sweet are thy words unto my taste! Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.  NUN.  Thy word I have sworn, and I will perform I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word. Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments. My soul The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts. Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, I hate Thou Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God. Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope. Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually. Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.  AIN.  I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors. Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me. Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness. Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes. I NoneTherefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold. Therefore I esteem all Thy testimonies The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments. Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes. Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.  TZADDE.  Righteous Thy testimonies My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words. Thy word I Thy righteousness Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: The righteousness of thy testimonies I cried with I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies. I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word. Mine eyes prevent the Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment. They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law. Thou Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.  RESH.  Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law. Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word. Salvation Great Many I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word. Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness. Thy word Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word. I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil. I hate and abhor lying: Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments. Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them. LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments. My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly. I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word. Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word. My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes. My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts. I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me. I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.    In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me. Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. I I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The LORD The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.    I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD. Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.    Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. Behold, as the eyes of servants Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, If If Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. Blessed Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. Our help They that trust in the LORD As the mountains For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. Do good, O LORD, unto As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them. The LORD hath done great things for us; Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south. They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh NoneLo, children As arrows Happy Blessed For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy Thy wife Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD. The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. Yea, thou shalt see thy children’s children, Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say: Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me. The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows. The LORD Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. Let them be as the grass Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD. Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? But I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. My soul Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.    LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.    LORD, remember David, How he sware unto the LORD, Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; I will not give sleep to mine eyes, Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood. We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool. Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy. For thy servant David’s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed. The LORD hath sworn If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore. For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired This I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.    Behold, how good and how pleasant NoneAs the dew of Hermon, Behold, bless ye the LORD, all Lift up your hands The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.    Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God, Praise the LORD; for the LORD For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, For I know that the LORD Whatsoever the LORD pleased, He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries. Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. NoneWho smote great nations, and slew mighty kings; Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan: And gave their land Thy name, O LORD, For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants. The idols of the heathen They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there They that make them are like unto them: Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron: Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD. Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.    O give thanks unto the LORD; for O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy To him that made great lights: for his mercy The sun to rule by day: for his mercy The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy To him which smote great kings: for his mercy And slew famous kings: for his mercy Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy NoneWho remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us How shall we sing the LORD’S song in a strange land? If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy Happy I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee. I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth. Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great Though the LORD Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me. The LORD will perfect O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted For Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. NoneWhither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou NoneEven there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother’s womb. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! NoneSurely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men. For they speak against thee wickedly, Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies. Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: And see if Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man; Which imagine mischiefs in They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders’ poison Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings. The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah. I said unto the LORD, Thou O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle. Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; NoneLet burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again. Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.    LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee. Let my prayer be set forth before thee Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips. Incline not my heart to Let the righteous smite me; When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet. Our bones are scattered at the grave’s mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth But mine eyes Keep me from the snares Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.    I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication. I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. I looked on I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.    Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead. Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate. I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands. I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee. Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me. Teach me to do thy will; for thou Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name’s sake: for thy righteousness’ sake bring my soul out of trouble. And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I Blessed My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and LORD, what Man is like to vanity: his days Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them. Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children; Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery NoneRid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand That our sons NoneNoneHappy I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. Great One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works. And They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. The LORD The LORD All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. Thy kingdom The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season. Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing. The LORD The LORD He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them. The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy. My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.    Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul. While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. Put not your trust in princes, His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. Happy Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners: The LORD openeth The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. The LORD shall reign for ever, Praise ye the LORD: for The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by Great The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground. Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God: Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. He giveth to the beast his food, He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man. The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy. Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion. For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee. He maketh peace He sendeth forth his commandment He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoar frost like ashes. He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold? He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation: and Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights. Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created. He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass. Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word: Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars: Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl: Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth: Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation. Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds. NoneTo execute vengeance upon the heathen, To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.    Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power. Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.

the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.The fear of the LORD My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:For they My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:My son, walk not thou in the way with them;

I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity;

and thy labours And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee.Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.NoneAnd why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?For the ways of man His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.Do this now, my son, deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend;

suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.These six A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,A false witness My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:Bind them continually upon thine heart, When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and For the commandment To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.For by means of a whorish woman Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.NoneBut NoneA wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.For jealousy He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.Say unto wisdom, Thou That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,Passing through the street near her corner;

as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong Her house Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.Unto you, O men, I call;

all What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?NoneThe sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea All things The thing that hath been, it Is there NoneI the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all NoneI communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.For in much wisdom I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also I said of laughter, I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:I got I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.The wise man’s eyes Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also For Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.For there is a man whose labour For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?For all his days NoneFor who can eat, or who else can hasten For To every A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.He hath made every I know that And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?Wherefore I perceive that So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.Yea, better Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.Better Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.There is one Two For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.Better For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.NoneKeep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool’s voice When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for Better Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it For in the multitude of dreams and many words If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good The sleep of a labouring man There is a sore evil But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.And this also All his days also he eateth in darkness, and Behold Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this If a man beget an hundred For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known Yea, though he live a thousand years twice All the labour of man For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?Better That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what For who knoweth what A good name NoneSorrow The heart of the wise NoneFor as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.Better Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.Say not thou, What is Wisdom For wisdom Consider the work of God: for who can make In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.All Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?NoneWisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty For Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.Who I Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.Where the word of a king Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment.Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?NoneAll this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred All This For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it NoneNow there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.Then said I, Wisdom The words of wise Wisdom Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: A wise man’s heart Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.There is an evil Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.The words of a wise man’s mouth The beginning of the words of his mouth A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.Woe to thee, O land, when thy king Blessed By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.If the clouds be full of rain, they empty He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.As thou knowest not what In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both Truly the light But if a man live many years, Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;Also Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and The words of the wise And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this The song of songs, which Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.I Look not upon me, because I Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents.I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh’s chariots.Thy cheeks are comely with rows We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.While the king A bundle of myrrh My beloved Behold, thou Behold, thou The beams of our house I As the lily among thorns, so As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I His left hand I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines O my dove, Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines My beloved Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.The watchmen that go about the city found me: NoneI charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake Who Behold his bed, which They all hold swords, King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.He made the pillars thereof Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.Behold, thou Thy teeth Thy lips Thy neck Thy two breasts Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.Thou Come with me from Lebanon, Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, How fair is thy love, my sister, Thy lips, O A garden inclosed Thy plants Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, I am come into my garden, my sister, I sleep, but my heart waketh: I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?My beloved put in his hand by the hole I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I What My beloved His head His eyes His cheeks His hands His legs His mouth Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.I Thou Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair Thy teeth As a piece of a pomegranate There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.My dove, my undefiled is Who I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, Or ever I was aware, my soul made me Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince’s daughter! the joints of thy thighs Thy navel Thy two breasts Thy neck Thine head upon thee How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth I Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates O that thou I would lead thee, His left hand I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake Who Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?If she I Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand My vineyard, which Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.From the sole of the foot even unto the head Your country And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.To what purpose When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:Thy princes Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.And it shall come to pass in the last days, And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.For the day of the LORD of hosts And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.And the idols he shall utterly abolish.And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.Cease ye from man, whose breath For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.And I will give children And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide Say ye to the righteous, that Woe unto the wicked! NoneThe LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor What mean ye Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,The rings, and nose jewels,The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.And it shall come to pass, Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth And it shall come to pass, When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts Woe unto them that join house to house, In mine ears Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:That say, Let him make speed, Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!Woe unto Woe unto Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:Whose arrows Their roaring And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.Then said I, Woe Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, And he laid Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,And the LORD have removed men far away, and But yet in it And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field;And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.For the head of Syria And the head of Ephraim Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; And it shall come to pass in that day, And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, And it shall come to pass in that day, And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk And it shall come to pass in that day, With arrows and with bows shall And Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man’s pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz.And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son;Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,Say ye not, A confederacy, to all Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and Nevertheless the dimness The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.Thou hast multiplied the nation, For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.For every battle of the warrior For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.Of the increase of The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.And all the people shall know, The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.The ancient and honourable, he For the leaders of this people cause Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother.And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but For he saith, NoneAs my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?Wherefore it shall come to pass, For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth.And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.And it shall come to pass in that day, The remnant shall return, For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction.And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and And it shall come to pass in that day, He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice’ den.They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.And it shall come to pass in that day, And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.Behold, God Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, Howl ye; for the day of the LORD Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man’s heart shall melt:And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.And I will punish the world for I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and NoneAnd Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees’ excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, The whole earth is at rest, Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, NoneAll the kings of the nations, But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD.I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts.The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.This For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent’s root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, What shall The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-elim.For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.For it shall be, Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.We have heard of the pride of Moab; Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn; surely For the fields of Heshbon languish, Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-haresh.And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.This But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from The cities of Aroer The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.And in that day it shall come to pass, And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel: and there shall be desolation.Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange slips:In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: Woe to the multitude of many people, The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but And behold at eveningtide trouble; Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruninghooks, and take away They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.And they shall turn the rivers far away; The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded.And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices Surely the princes of Zoan Where The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken Neither shall there be In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shaketh over it.And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction.In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD.And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.And he saw a chariot And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous city: thy slain All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.For And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men And it shall come to pass, And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest.Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall.Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die.And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here, Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity, and will surely cover thee.He will surely violently turn and toss thee And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he pull thee down.And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father’s house.And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, As at the report concerning Egypt, Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.NoneWho hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no rest.Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word.The earth mourneth The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh.The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.NoneIn the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, Fear, and the pit, and the snare, And it shall come to pass, The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.And it shall come to pass in that day, And they shall be gathered together, Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.O LORD, thou For thou hast made of a city an heap; Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.Thou wilt keep Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, The foot shall tread it down, The way of the just Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments Let favour be shewed to the wicked, LORD, LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.O LORD our God, NoneThou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer Like as a woman with child, We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.Thy dead Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest Fury Or let him take hold of my strength, He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.Yet the defenced city When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the women come, And it shall come to pass in that day, And it shall come to pass in that day, Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet:And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble For all tables are full of vomit Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? For precept For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.To whom he said, This But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.For the bed is shorter than that For the LORD shall rise up as Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground?When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and rie in their place?For his God doth instruct him to discretion, For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.Bread This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.And thou shalt be brought down, Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.It shall even be as when an hungry Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter’s clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?NoneAnd in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.The meek also shall increase For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.They were all ashamed of a people The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:That this Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters’ vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.One thousand And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.And And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and Ye shall have a song, as in the night And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, And For Tophet Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because Yet he also Now the Egyptians For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver Turn ye unto For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.The instruments also of the churl But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech.Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.Blessed Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.And your spoil shall be gathered The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.The earth mourneth Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: Hear, ye The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;He shall dwell on high: his place of defence Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle But there the glorious LORD For the LORD Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it.For the indignation of the LORD Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.For And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.Say to them Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.Then shall the lame And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it No lion shall be there, nor And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field.Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph’s son, the recorder.And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?I say, Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.NoneWhere Who But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard And he sent Eliakim, who And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, Where And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,And have cast their gods into the fire: for they Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:This Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.Hast thou not heard long ago, Therefore their inhabitants But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.And this And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.And this Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.I said, I shall not see the LORD, Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd’s tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day I reckoned till morning, Like a crane What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done O Lord, by these Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul For the grave cannot praise thee, death can The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I The LORD For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay Hezekiah also had said, What At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:Behold, the days come, that all that And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD’S hand double for all her sins.The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or With whom took he counsel, and Behold, the nations And Lebanon All nations before him To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.He that Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning?

Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;And ye have done worse than your fathers;

and there shall ye die.But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not return.NoneO earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the LORD.Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD.And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD.Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.NoneCan any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.How long shall Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What NoneTherefore, behold, I Behold, I Behold, I And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What And Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken?And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man’s word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD;Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs One basket Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull And I will give them an heart to know me, that I And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever:And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words,Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.And this whole land shall be a desolation, And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.Then took I the cup at the LORD’S hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me:NonePharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea,Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert,And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread A noise shall come Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD.He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD’S house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD’S house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king’s house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD’S Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.As for me, behold, I But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters;I have made the earth, the man and the beast that And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.And it shall come to pass, Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD’S house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?But if they For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city,Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD’S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD’S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people;The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and brake it.And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.Now these (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;Build ye houses, and dwell Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD.For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.And ye shall seek me, and find And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;NoneThus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them:Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours’ wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and NoneThus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?For therefore he sent unto us And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.And these For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?Alas! for that day For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make For I For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise NoneAll thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.Thus saith the LORD, The people The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat For there shall be a day, For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border.I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon NoneSet thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the highway, How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.And it shall come to pass, In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day But this And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that So Hanameel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed So I took the evidence of the purchase, And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle’s And I charged Baruch before them, saying,Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,Behold, I Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD.For this city hath been to me Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.And they built the high places of Baal, which And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;NoneAs the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, so that I will not take The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:NoneThen Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,When the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.NoneThat every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which are gone up from you.Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD.The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father’s commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you:Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even into this day.It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD’S house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD’S house.And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD’S house, in the ears of all the people.When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,Then he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and And it came to pass, Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim the king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.Then Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward Then said Jeremiah, Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?Where Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which shall take it.Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;Ebed-melech went forth out of the king’s house, and spake to the king, saying,My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.So Ebed- melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver But if thou refuse to go forth, this And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.NoneAnd all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, And it came to pass, But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying,Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s princes;Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon.And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.Now the LORD hath brought And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which Now while he was not yet gone back, Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.Now when all the captains of the forces which Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put Likewise when all the Jews that Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.Now it came to pass in the seventh month, Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.And it was But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that Now it came to pass, So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.Whether And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah.Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;Then it shall come to pass, So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do And Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go And it came to pass, Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah.But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;NoneSo they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh, that The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?They are not humbled Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,NoneBut we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.And this Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch;Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles;Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with Wherefore have I seen them dismayed Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.Who Egypt riseth up like a flood, and Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle For this Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee.Why are thy valiant He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt NoneO thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.Egypt Also her hired men The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD.But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off O thou sword of the LORD, how long How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it.Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded NoneA voice of crying Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.Cursed Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.How say ye, We Moab is spoiled, and gone up The calamity of Moab All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; and tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.Make ye him drunken: for he magnified For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; From the cry of Heshbon Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: because the riches For every head NoneThey shall howl, For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men’s hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.And Moab shall be destroyed from Fear, and the pit, and the snare, He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; Damascus is waxed feeble, How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad.Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD.But it shall come to pass in the latter days, The word that the LORD spake against Babylon Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.Israel Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and Go up against the land of Merathaim, A sound of battle How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.Behold, I And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah Their Redeemer A sword A sword A sword A drought Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.They shall hold the bow and the lance: they The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.Against Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and For Israel Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this Babylon Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed.We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon.O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding.When he uttereth Every man is brutish by They The portion of Jacob Thou And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD.Behold, I And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD.Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.The violence done to me and to my flesh Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions’ whelps.In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.Then the heaven and the earth, and all that As Babylon Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD’S house.Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, A sound of a cry Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:Because the spoiler is come upon her, And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name And he did For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.And in the fourth month, in the ninth Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.Now in the fifth month, in the tenth And burned the house of the LORD, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great And all the army of the Chaldeans, that Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left Also the pillars of brass that The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that And And a chapiter of brass And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king’s person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar- adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.How doth the city sit solitary, She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.Her filthiness The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.NoneFrom above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty For these Zion spreadeth forth her hands, The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.I called for my lovers, Behold, O LORD; for I They have heard that I sigh: Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought He hath cut off in He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.They say to their mothers, Where What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.All that pass by clap All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed The LORD hath done Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD’S anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.I He hath led me, and brought Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.He hath builded against me, and compassed He hath set me in dark places, as He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.He He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.I was a derision to all my people; He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.My soul hath This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.NoneNoneThe LORD The LORD NoneNoneHe sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.He giveth For the Lord will not cast off for ever:But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.Who Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.Let us lift up our heart with We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that Thou hast made us All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.Waters flowed over mine head; I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.Thou drewest near in the day O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.Thou hast seen all their vengeance Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.How is the gold become dim! The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.NoneThe hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.For the sins of her prophets, They have wandered They cried unto them, Depart ye; The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.Our necks We have given the hand Our fathers have sinned, Servants have ruled over us: We gat our bread with Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.They ravished the women in Zion, Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.The crown is fallen For this our heart is faint; for these Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth In the fifth The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness Also out of the midst thereof And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.And their feet And Their wings As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.Thus And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.The appearance of the wheels and their work When they went, they went upon their four sides: As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither When those went, And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature And under the firmament And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.And there was a voice from the firmament that And above the firmament that And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, For And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.And when I looked, behold, an hand And he spread it before me; and it Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.For thou Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, NoneSo the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.Again, When a righteous Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, And thy meat which thou shalt eat Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.And thou shalt eat it And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber’s razor, and cause Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; Thus saith the Lord GOD; This And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.Wherefore, A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.And they shall know that I Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.Then shall ye know that I So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.Now And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath The sword But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak They shall also gird They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about.And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD’S house which Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD’S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:Slay utterly old And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, And the sound of the cherubims’ wings was heard And it came to pass, And And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand under their wings.And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels And When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.And every one had four faces: the first face And the cherubims were lifted up. This And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.When they stood, Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims.And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also This Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man And the likeness of their faces Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD’S house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, the princes of the people.Then said he unto me, Son of man, these Which say, Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD.And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I This And ye shall know that I And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, thy brethren, Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.But Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me.The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying,Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.In their sight shalt thou bear And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden Say, I And the prince that My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon And I will scatter toward every wind all that And they shall know that I But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, what Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.For I Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,Son of man, behold, Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD;Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and Say unto them which daub it with untempered Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered NoneLikewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:NoneOr Though these three men Or Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity And None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers’ skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord GOD;)NoneThou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;NoneThey give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.And the contrary is in thee from Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use Thou And thine elder sister Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as NoneBehold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.Yea, behold, Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these And hath taken of the king’s seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place Neither shall Pharaoh with Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge?NoneBehold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,NoneAnd hath not oppressed any, He Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he If he beget a son And that doeth not any of those Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.Now, lo, NoneNeither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, NoneNoneYet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?When a righteous Again, when the wicked Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,And say, What And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.Now when she saw that she had waited, And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his roaring.Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.Thy mother And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.And now she And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me? Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I In the day Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:I And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.Wherefore I gave them also statutes And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.NoneThen I said unto them, What Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations?For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.NoneAnd I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.And ye shall know that I And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.And ye shall know that I Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak parables?And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it Because Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that Go thee one way or other, I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of Shall I cause And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come NoneBehold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.In thee have they discovered their fathers’ nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father’s daughter.In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.NoneYea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, say unto her, Thou NoneHer priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed Her princes in the midst thereof And her prophets have daubed them with untempered The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.And the names of them And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians NoneThus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them Neither left she her whoredoms Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.And when her sister Aholibah saw She doted upon the Assyrians Then I saw that she was defiled, And Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.I will do these Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.Thou shalt even drink it and suck Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.And a voice of a multitude being at ease Then said I unto Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth Son of man, write thee the name of the day, And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set Gather the pieces thereof into it, Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and She hath wearied In thy filthiness I the LORD have spoken Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover And your tires Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I Also, thou son of man, NoneIn that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.It shall be And her daughters which For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee.And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee;When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;I will make thee a terror, and thou The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, Thy borders They have made all thy NoneFine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise The ancients of Gebal and the wise They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.The men of Arvad with thine army Tarshish Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.The men of Dedan Syria Judah, and the land of Israel, they Damascus Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.Dedan Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, These The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.And all that handle the oar, the mariners, And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.In the time All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thine heart Behold, thou With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures:By thy great wisdom Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God;Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone Thou Thou By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it,And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her street; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I In the tenth year, in the tenth Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.And I will leave thee And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I Behold, therefore I No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.I have given him the land of Egypt In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Howl ye, Woe worth the dayFor the day And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries And they shall know that I In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh.Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No.And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph The young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword: and these At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh’s arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?Behold, the Assyrian The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.They also went down into hell with him unto To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net.Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord GOD.When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I This It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.They shall fall in the midst of The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.Asshur Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.There They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves There And they shall not lie with the mighty Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with There There Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.When I say unto the wicked, O wicked Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins Say unto them, Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his When I shall say to the righteous, Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;NoneNone of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour’s wife: and shall ye possess the land?Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.Then shall they know that I Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, And, lo, thou And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up And they were scattered, because My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;NoneTherefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD.I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up And NoneAnd Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed Therefore, Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.And I will fill his mountains with his slain I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.And thou shalt know that I Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD:Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they have made Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen:Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen that But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come.For, behold, I And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord GOD.Neither will I cause Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that Not for your sakes do I Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.And ye shall know that I And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.And David my servant And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold I And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet:Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee.Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army:And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.Thus saith the Lord GOD; And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, For in my jealousy So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man’s sword shall be against his brother.And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the people that Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down And it shall come to pass in that day, And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land.Yea, all the people of the land shall bury And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.And the passengers And also the name of the city And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.So the house of Israel shall know that I And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;Then shall they know that I Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which And he brought me thither, and, behold, And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, And He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate And the little chambers of the gate eastward And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; The space also before the little chambers He measured then the gate from the roof of He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate And Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.And the little chambers thereof And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, And the gate of the inner court After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.And And And And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and And the arches round about And the arches thereof And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures.And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, And the arches thereof And he brought me to the north gate, and measured The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length And the posts thereof And the chambers and the entries thereof And in the porch of the gate And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, Four tables And the four tables And within And without the inner gate And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect And the chamber whose prospect So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured The length of the porch Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, And the breadth of the door Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of And the side chambers And I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers The thickness of the wall, which And between the chambers And the doors of the side chambers Now the building that So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.And So that the face of a man From the ground unto above the door The posts of the temple The altar of wood And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.And the doors had two leaves And And Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that Before the length of an hundred cubits Over against the twenty And before the chambers Now the upper chambers For they And the wall that For the length of the chambers that And from under these chambers The chambers And the way before them And according to the doors of the chambers that Then said he unto me, The north chambers When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.He turned about to the west side, He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred Afterward he brought me to the gate, And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice And And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.And I heard And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write This And these And from the bottom So the altar And the altar And the settle And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD;

and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse When thou hast made an end of cleansing And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.And when these days are expired, it shall be, Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.NoneThen brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face.And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.And thou shalt say to the rebellious, In that ye have brought And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD:They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.And it shall come to pass, They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird And when they go forth into the utter court, Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.And they shall teach my people And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord GOD.And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.And the first of all the firstfruits of all The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary The holy And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy And In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord GOD.Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. IThe ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.And the shekel This Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord GOD.All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel.And it shall be the prince’s part Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put And so thou shalt do the seventh In the first And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.In the seventh Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day And the meat offering And in the day of the new moon And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it.And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD.Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons’; it But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons’ for them.Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; After he brought me through the entry, which Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court In the four corners of the court And Then said he unto me, These Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters Afterward he measured a thousand; And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: And it shall come to pass, And it shall come to pass, But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.Thus saith the Lord GOD; This And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: And this Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And And the south side southward, from Tamar The west side also So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.And it shall come to pass, And it shall come to pass, Now these And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, a And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, a And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, a And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side, a And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, a And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, a And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and twenty thousand The oblation that ye shall offer unto the LORD And for them, NoneAnd And over against the border of the priests the Levites And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the firstfruits of the land: for And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane And these And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel.All the oblation And the residue Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, Simeon And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, Issachar a And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side, Zebulun a And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, Gad a And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar This And these And the gates of the city And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three gates; and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan.And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures: and three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of Zebulun.At the west side four thousand and five hundred, In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring Children in whom And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat.Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.And in all matters of wisdom And Daniel continued And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore And For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise And the decree went forth that the wise Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof This image’s head His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.This Thou, O king, And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.And And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,NoneAnd whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.Then Nebuchadnezzar in Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we If it be But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: And he commanded the most mighty men that Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- nego.And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.NoneTherefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.How great I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods Thus The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:The leaves thereof I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.This matter This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise Then Daniel, whose name The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;Whose leaves It And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and This That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquility.All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?While the word And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion And all the inhabitants of the earth At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. Then came in all the king’s wise Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.NoneThere is a man in thy kingdom, in whom Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.Then was Daniel brought in before the king. I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods And now the wise And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.And this This TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.And Darius the Median took the kingdom, It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king’s decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which Then the king, when he heard Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.The first And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.I saw in the night visions, and, behold, And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.These great beasts, which are four, But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth And of the ten horns that I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.And the ten horns out of this kingdom And he shall speak But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom Hitherto In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat And he came to the ram that had And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant And it waxed great, Yea, he magnified And an host was given Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.And it came to pass, when I, And I heard a man’s voice between So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end The ram which thou sawest having And the rough goat Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told And I Daniel fainted, and was sick In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.O Lord, righteousness O Lord, to us To the Lord our God Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.As Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake.O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.And whiles I Yea, whiles I And he informed At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.Know therefore and understand, And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins His body also And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.And, behold, For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.Then there came again and touched me And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.And the king of the south shall be strong, and And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in But out of a branch of her roots shall And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, So the king of the south shall come into But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, NoneFor the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.And after the league He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.And both these kings’ hearts Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.And And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river.And And I heard the man clothed in linen, which And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.And from the time Blessed The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.Then said Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ru-hamah.Plead with your mother, plead: for she Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of So I bought her to me for fifteen And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.As they were increased, so they sinned against me: They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.Ephraim Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: Ephraim Therefore When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah For I will I will go Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.Then shall we know, O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness Therefore have I hewed For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.Gilead And as troops of robbers wait for a man, I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, And they consider not in their hearts They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.They In the day of our king the princes have made For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, Though I have bound They return, NoneIsrael shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.Israel hath cast off They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast For from Israel For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.I have written to him the great things of my law, They sacrifice flesh For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.They shall not dwell in the LORD’S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean They shall not offer wine What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know The watchman of Ephraim They have deeply corrupted I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: NoneThough they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give?

Consider your ways.Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.Ye looked for much, and, lo, Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.Then spake Haggai the LORD’S messenger in the LORD’S message unto the people, saying, I And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.In the seventh Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,Who Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for NoneFor thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.The silver The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts.In the four and twentieth Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.Then said Haggai, If Then answered Haggai, and said, So And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:Since those I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet ye Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and Your fathers, where But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that Then said I, O my lord, what And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.And I am very sore displeased with the heathen Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.Ho, ho, Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all And two olive trees by it, one upon the right So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This Who Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel Then answered I, and said unto him, What And I answered again, and said unto him, What And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these Then said he, These Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof Then said he unto me, This I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what And I said, What And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this And he said, This Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains In the first chariot And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What And the angel answered and said unto me, These The black horses which And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,Take of Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.And they And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,NoneThen came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat NoneAnd the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother:And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.Yea, they made their hearts Therefore it is come to pass, But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.Again the word of the LORD of hosts came Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither But now I For the seed And it shall come to pass, For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not:So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.These And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth Thus saith the LORD of hosts; And the inhabitants of one Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise.And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.Ashkelon shall see And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the LORD GOD shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they For how great Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.And they shall be as mighty And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I And I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.NoneThus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour’s hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver And I will feed the flock of slaughter, Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.And I took my staff, And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it And I said unto them, If ye think good, give And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty Then I cut asunder mine other staff, And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness.And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David And it shall come to pass in that day, And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, And it shall come to pass, And it shall come to pass in that day, But he shall say, I And Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man And it shall come to pass, And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which And ye shall flee And it shall come to pass in that day, But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, And it shall be in that day, And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one.All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin’s gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and And And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.And it shall come to pass in that day, And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.And it shall come to pass, And it shall be, And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD’S house shall be like the bowls before the altar.The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.A son honoureth Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.Who For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness But cursed And now, O ye priests, this commandment If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts.And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he And he shall sit Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in For I Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.Ye Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken Ye have said, It And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.So all the generations from Abraham to David Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.Then Joseph her husband, being a just But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.When Herod the king had heard And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child’s life.And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and Whose fan Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?And Jesus answering said unto him, And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.But he answered and said, Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in Jesus said unto him, Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.Then saith Jesus unto him, Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.And he saith unto them, And they straightway left And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:For he taught them as When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.And Jesus put forth And Jesus saith unto him, And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.And Jesus saith unto him, The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this When Jesus heard NoneNoneAnd Jesus said unto the centurion, And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother laid, and sick of a fever.And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.And Jesus saith unto him, And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.But Jesus said unto him, And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.And his disciples came to And he saith unto them, But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.And he said unto them, And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, NoneNoneAnd he arose, and departed to his house.But when the multitudes saw And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.And when the Pharisees saw But when Jesus heard NoneThen came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?And Jesus said unto them, NoneNoneWhile he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.And Jesus arose, and followed him, and And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,He said unto them, But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Then touched he their eyes, saying, And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.Then saith he unto his disciples, NoneAnd when he had called unto Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?Jesus answered and said unto them, NoneNoneAnd as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThen began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:NoneNoneNoneNoneAt that time Jesus answered and said, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAt that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.But when the Pharisees saw But he said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:And, behold, there was a man which had And he said unto them, NoneThen saith he to the man, Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.But when Jesus knew And charged them that they should not make him known:That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?But when the Pharisees heard And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThen certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.But he answered and said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneWhile he yet talked to the people, behold, Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.But he answered and said unto him that told him, And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, NoneThe same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?He answered and said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnother parable put he forth unto them, saying, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnother parable put he forth unto them, saying, NoneAnother parable spake he unto them; All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.He answered and said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneJesus saith unto them, Then said he unto them, And it came to pass, And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist’s head in a charger.And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath’s sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.When Jesus heard And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.But Jesus said unto them, And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.He said, And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.And he said, But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.And immediately Jesus stretched forth And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.But he answered and said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd he called the multitude, and said unto them, NoneThen came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?But he answered and said, NoneThen answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.And Jesus said, NoneNoneNoneNoneThen Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.But he answered and said, Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.But he answered and said, And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.Then Jesus answered and said unto her, And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.And great multitudes came unto him, having with them Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.Then Jesus called his disciples And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?And Jesus saith unto them, And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala,The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.He answered and said unto them, NoneNoneAnd when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.Then Jesus said unto them, And they reasoned among themselves, saying, NoneNoneNoneNoneThen understood they how that he bade When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, And they said, Some He saith unto them, And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.And Jesus answered and said unto him, NoneNoneThen charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.But he turned, and said unto Peter, Then said Jesus unto his disciples, NoneNoneNoneNoneAnd after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.And when the disciples heard And Jesus came and touched them, and said, And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?And Jesus answered and said unto them, NoneThen the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.Then Jesus answered and said, And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?And Jesus said unto them, NoneAnd while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, NoneAnd when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, NoneAt the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,And said, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThen came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?Jesus saith unto him, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd it came to pass, And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?And he answered and said unto them, NoneNoneThey say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?He saith unto them, NoneHis disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with But he said unto them, NoneThen were there brought unto him little children, that he should put But Jesus said, And he laid And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?And he said unto him, He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, NoneThe young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?Jesus said unto him, But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.Then said Jesus unto his disciples, NoneWhen his disciples heard But Jesus beheld Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?And Jesus said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,NoneNoneThen came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children with her sons, worshipping And he said unto her, But Jesus answered and said, And he saith unto them, And when the ten heard But Jesus called them NoneNoneNoneAnd as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.So Jesus had compassion And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,Saying unto them, NoneAll this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,And said unto them, And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased,And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, And when the disciples saw Jesus answered and said unto them, NoneAnd when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?And Jesus answered and said unto them, NoneBut if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThey say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out Jesus saith unto them, NoneNoneAnd when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThen went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, NoneAnd he saith unto them, They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, When they had heard The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.And last of all the woman died also.Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.Jesus answered and said unto them, NoneNoneNoneAnd when the multitude heard But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.Then one of them, Master, which Jesus said unto him, NoneNoneNoneWhile the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,Saying, He saith unto them, NoneNoneAnd no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,Saying, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to And Jesus said unto them, And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what And Jesus answered and said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,NoneThen assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill But they said, Not on the feast Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat But when his disciples saw For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.When Jesus understood NoneNoneNoneThen one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,And said And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.Now the first And he said, And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.And as they did eat, he said, And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?And he answered and said, NoneThen Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave NoneNoneAnd when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.Then saith Jesus unto them, NonePeter answered and said unto him, Though all Jesus said unto him, Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.Then saith he unto them, And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, NoneHe went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, NoneAnd while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.And Jesus said unto him, And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out Then said Jesus unto him, NoneNoneIn that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, NoneAnd they that had laid hold on Jesus led But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, And said, This And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.Jesus saith unto him, Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.But he denied before And when he was gone out into the porch, another And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.And after a while came unto Then began he to curse and to swear, And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:And when they had bound him, they led Then Judas, which had betrayeth him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.Now at And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but Then answered all the people, and said, His blood Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.And sitting down they watched him there;And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest Likewise also the chief priests mocking He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Some of them that stood there, when they heard And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, Then said Jesus unto them, Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, NoneThe beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:And there came a voice from heaven, And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,And saying, Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.And Jesus said unto them, And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,Saying, Let And Jesus rebuked him, saying, And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.And all the city was gathered together at the door.And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.And when they had found him, they said unto him, All And he said unto them, And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;And saith unto him, But he went out, and began to publish And again he entered into Capernaum, after And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,Why doth this And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, NoneNoneNoneAnd immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.And as he passed by, he saw Levi the And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?When Jesus heard And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?And Jesus said unto them, NoneNoneNoneAnd it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?And he said unto them, NoneAnd he said unto them, NoneAnd he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, And he saith unto them, And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:And Simon he surnamed Peter;And James the And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.And when his friends heard And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.And he called them NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneBecause they said, He hath an unclean spirit.There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.And he answered them, saying, And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, NoneAnd he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd he said unto them, And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.And he said unto them, NoneAnd he said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd he said unto them, NoneNoneAnd he said unto them, NoneAnd he said, NoneNoneNoneAnd he said, NoneNoneAnd with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, And he said unto them, And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,Who had Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, For he said unto him, And he asked him, And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.And they that fed the swine fled, and told And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.And they that saw And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: And And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.And he said unto her, While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.And when he was come in, he saith unto them, And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.But Jesus said unto them, And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.And he called And commanded them that they should take nothing for But And he said unto them, NoneAnd they went out, and preached that men should repent.And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed And king Herod heard Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.But when Herod heard For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife: for he had married her.For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.And the king was exceeding sorry; And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.And when his disciples heard And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.And he said unto them, And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.He answered and said unto them, He saith unto them, And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave And they did all eat, and were filled.And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.For they considered not And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash And Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?He answered and said unto them, NoneNoneAnd he said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneAnd when he had called all the people NoneNoneAnd when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.And he saith unto them, NoneAnd he said, NoneNoneNoneAnd from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know For a The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.But Jesus said unto her, And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.And he said unto her, And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples NoneNoneAnd his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these And he asked them, And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.Now And he charged them, saying, And they reasoned among themselves, saying, And when Jesus knew NoneNoneNoneAnd he said unto them, And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.After that he put And he sent him away to his house, saying, And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, And they answered, John the Baptist: but some And he saith unto them, And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, And when he had called the people NoneNoneNoneNoneAnd he said unto them, And after six days Jesus taketh And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?And he answered and told them, NoneAnd when he came to And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to And he asked the scribes, And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.He answereth him, and saith, And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.And he asked his father, And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.Jesus said unto him, And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, And But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?And he said unto them, And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,NoneAnd John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.But Jesus said, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away And he answered and said unto them, And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put And Jesus answered and said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneAnd in the house his disciples asked him again of the same And he saith unto them, NoneAnd they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and But when Jesus saw NoneAnd he took them up in his arms, put And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?And Jesus said unto him, NoneAnd he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, NoneAnd they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?And Jesus looking upon them saith, Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.And Jesus answered and said, NoneNoneAnd they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,NoneNoneAnd James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.And he said unto them, They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.But Jesus said unto them, And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, NoneAnd when the ten heard But Jesus called them NoneNoneNoneAnd they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.And Jesus answered and said unto him, And Jesus said unto him, And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,And saith unto them, NoneAnd they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed Blessed And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not And Jesus answered and said unto it, And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;And would not suffer that any man should carry And he taught, saying unto them, And the scribes and chief priests heard And when even was come, he went out of the city.And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.And Jesus answering saith unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneAnd they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?And Jesus answered and said unto them, NoneAnd they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, And he began to speak unto them by parables. NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, And they brought And Jesus answering said unto them, Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.And Jesus answering said unto them, NoneNoneNoneAnd one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?And Jesus answered him, NoneNoneAnd the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, NoneNoneAnd he said unto them in his doctrine, NoneNoneAnd Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.And he called NoneAnd as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings And Jesus answering said unto him, And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,Tell us, when shall these things be? and what And Jesus answering them began to say, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAfter two days was But they said, Not on the feast And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.And Jesus said, NoneNoneNoneAnd Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.And when they heard And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, NoneNoneAnd his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, And he answered and said unto them, NoneAnd as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave And he said unto them, NoneAnd when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.And Jesus saith unto them, NoneBut Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet And Jesus saith unto him, But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;And saith unto them, And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.And he said, And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, NoneAnd again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, NoneAnd immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and the scribes and the elders.And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.And they laid their hands on him, and took him.And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.And Jesus answered and said unto them, NoneAnd they all forsook him, and fled.And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.But neither so did their witness agree together.And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?And Jesus said, Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art But he began to curse and to swear, And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.Now at And there was And the multitude crying aloud began to desire But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do And they cried out again, Crucify him.Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.And And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest Save thyself, and come down from the cross.Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, And some of them that stood by, when they heard And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling And when he knew And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.And Mary Magdalene and Mary And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the And very early in the morning the first And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any Now when NoneAnd they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.And they went and told Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.And he said unto them, NoneNoneNoneSo then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.And when Zacharias saw But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s womb.And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, And when she saw And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.For with God nothing shall be impossible.And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed And whence For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.And blessed And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy And his mercy He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.He hath put down the mighty from He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.And his mother answered and said, Not And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.And all they that heard And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,Blessed And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;To perform the mercy The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,To give light to them that sit in darkness and And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.(And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.And this And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.And when they had seen And all they that heard But Mary kept all these things, and pondered And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;And she And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s journey; and they sought him among And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.And he said unto them, And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;John answered, saying unto Whose fan And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people.But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was Which was Which was Which was Which was Which was Which was Which was Which was Which was Which was Which was Which was Which was Which was Which was And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.And Jesus answered him, saying, And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.And Jesus answered and said unto him, And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:And in And Jesus answering said unto him, And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,NoneNoneAnd he closed the book, and he gave And he began to say unto them, And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?And he said unto them, And he said, NoneNoneNoneAnd all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.But he passing through the midst of them went his way,And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,Saying, Let And Jesus rebuked him, saying, And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house. And Simon’s wife’s mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her.And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.And he said unto them, And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.And they beckoned unto When Simon Peter saw For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:And so And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on And he put forth And he charged him to tell no man: But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought And when they could not find by what And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, NoneNoneAnd immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, And he left all, rose up, and followed him.And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?And Jesus answering said unto them, NoneAnd they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise And he said unto them, NoneAnd he spake also a parable unto them; NoneNoneNoneAnd it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?And Jesus answering them said, NoneAnd he said unto them, And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Then said Jesus unto them, And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.And when it was day, he called Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,Matthew and Thomas, James the And Judas And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNow when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.And John calling When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?And in that same hour he cured many of Then Jesus answering said unto them, NoneAnd when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, NoneNoneNoneNoneAnd all the people that heard But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.And the Lord said, NoneNoneNoneNoneAnd one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that And stood at his feet behind Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw And Jesus answering said unto him, NoneNoneSimon answered and said, I suppose that And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, NoneNoneNoneAnd he said unto her, And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?And he said to the woman, And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:NoneNoneNoneNoneAnd his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?And he said, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThen came to him And it was told him And he answered and said unto them, Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.And he said unto them, And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)And Jesus asked him, saying, And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.When they that fed Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.They also which saw Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,NoneAnd it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,Came behind And Jesus said, And Jesus said, And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately.And he said unto her, While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s But when Jesus heard And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.And he said unto them, NoneNoneAnd they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.And the people, when they knew And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.But he said unto them, For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, And they did so, and made them all sit down.Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, They answering said, John the Baptist; but some He said unto them, And he straitly charged them, and commanded Saying, And he said to NoneNoneNoneNoneAnd it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.And Jesus answering said, And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,NoneBut they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,And said unto them, And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.And Jesus said unto him, And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.And when his disciples James and John saw But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, NoneAnd it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain And Jesus said unto him, And he said unto another, Jesus said unto him, And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.And Jesus said unto him, After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.Therefore said he unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.And he said unto them, NoneNoneIn that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, NoneAnd he turned him unto NoneAnd, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?He said unto him, And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.And he said unto him, But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?And Jesus answering said, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard his word.But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.And Jesus answered and said unto her, NoneAnd it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, NoneNoneAnd he said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.And others, tempting But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.But he said, And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.And when the Pharisee saw And the Lord said unto him, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThen answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.And he said, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.And he said unto him, And he said unto them, And he spake a parable unto them, saying, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd he said unto his disciples, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThen Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?And the Lord said, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd he said also to the people, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThere were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.And Jesus answering said unto them, NoneNoneNoneHe spake also this parable; NoneNoneNoneAnd he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up And when Jesus saw her, he called And he laid And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.The Lord then answered him, and said, NoneAnd when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.Then said he, NoneAnd again he said, NoneAnd he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them,NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThe same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.And he said unto them, NoneNoneNoneAnd it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy.And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, And they held their peace. And he took And answered them, saying, And they could not answer him again to these things.And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,NoneNoneNoneNoneThen said he also to him that bade him, NoneNoneAnd when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed Then said he unto him, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThen drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.And he spake this parable unto them, saying,NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd he said, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd he said also unto his disciples, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.And he said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThen said he unto the disciples, NoneNoneNoneAnd the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.And the Lord said, NoneNoneNoneNoneAnd it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:And they lifted up And when he saw And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,And fell down on And Jesus answering said, NoneAnd he said unto him, And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, NoneAnd he said unto the disciples, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, And he spake a parable unto them Saying, NoneNoneNoneAnd the Lord said, NoneNoneAnd he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when But Jesus called them NoneAnd a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?And Jesus said unto him, NoneAnd he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, NoneAnd they that heard And he said, Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.And he said unto them, NoneThen he took NoneNoneAnd they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.And he cried, saying, Jesus, And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,Saying, And Jesus said unto him, And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw And And, behold, And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.And when they saw And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore And Jesus said unto him, NoneAnd as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.He said therefore, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called Saying, NoneAnd they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?And they said, The Lord hath need of him.And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;Saying, Blessed And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.And he answered and said unto them, And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,Saying, NoneNoneAnd he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;Saying unto them, And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.And it came to pass, And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?And he answered and said unto them, NoneAnd they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.And they answered, that they could not tell whence And Jesus said unto them, Then began he to speak to the people this parable; NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd he beheld them, and said, NoneAnd the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.And they watched And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, NoneAnd he said unto them, And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.Then came to Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.Last of all the woman died also.Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.And Jesus answering said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneThen certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.And after that they durst not ask him any And he said unto them, NoneNoneNoneThen in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,NoneNoneAnd he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.And he said, NoneAnd as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,NoneAnd they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign And he said, NoneThen said he unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd he spake to them a parable; NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.And he sent Peter and John, saying, And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?And he said unto them, NoneNoneAnd they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.And he said unto them, NoneAnd he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, NoneAnd he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, NoneNoneAnd they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.And he said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAnd the Lord said, NoneAnd he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.And he said, And he said unto them, Then said he unto them, NoneAnd they said, Lord, behold, here And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.And when he was at the place, he said unto them, And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,Saying, And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,And said unto them, And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.But Jesus said unto him, When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.And Jesus answered and said, Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, NoneThen took they him, and led And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, NoneNoneThen said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Then said Pilate to the chief priests and And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.I will therefore chastise him, and release (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.But they cried, saying, Crucify And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.But Jesus turning unto them said, NoneNoneNoneAnd there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.Then said Jesus, And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.And Jesus said unto him, And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.And, behold, (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) This And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.Now upon the first And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:And as they were afraid, and bowed down He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,Saying, And they remembered his words,And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem And they talked together of all these things which had happened.And it came to pass, that, while they communed But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.And he said unto them, And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?And he said unto them, And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found Then he said unto them, NoneAnd beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.And they told what things And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.And he said unto them, NoneAnd when he had thus spoken, he shewed them And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.And he took And he said unto them, Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,And said unto them, NoneNoneNoneAnd he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.The same was in the beginning with God.All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.In him was life; and the life was the light of men.And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.There was a man sent from God, whose name The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all He was not that Light, but NoneHe was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.He came unto his own, and his own received him not.But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.For the law was given by Moses, No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?He said, I And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, He saith unto them, One of the two which heard John He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.Jesus answered and said unto him, And he saith unto him, And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.Jesus saith unto her, His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.Jesus saith unto them, And he saith unto them, When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;And said unto them that sold doves, And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?Jesus answered and said unto them, Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?But he spake of the temple of his body.When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.Jesus answered and said unto him, Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?Jesus answered, NoneNoneNoneNicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?Jesus answered and said unto him, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAfter these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.For John was not yet cast into prison.Then there arose a question between And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.He must increase, but I He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.And he must needs go through Samaria.Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.Jesus answered and said unto her, The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?Jesus answered and said unto her, NoneThe woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.Jesus saith unto her, The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, NoneThe woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.Jesus saith unto her, NoneNoneNoneThe woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.Jesus saith unto her, And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.But he said unto them, Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him Jesus saith unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneAnd many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.And many more believed because of his own word;And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.Then said Jesus unto him, The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.Jesus saith unto him, And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.So the father knew that This After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.Jesus saith unto him, And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.But Jesus answered them, Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.Then answered Jesus and said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAfter these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.When Jesus then lifted up And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto him,There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?And Jesus said, And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Therefore they gathered Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.And when even was And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.But he saith unto them, Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?Jesus answered them and said, NoneThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?Jesus answered and said unto them, They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.Then Jesus said unto them, NoneThen said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.And Jesus said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThe Jews then murmured at him, because he said, And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThe Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us Then Jesus said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThese things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, NoneNoneNoneAnd he said, From that Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.Jesus answered them, He spake of Judas Iscariot After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.For For neither did his brethren believe in him.Then Jesus said unto them, NoneNoneWhen he had said these words unto them, he abode But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?Jesus answered them, and said, NoneNoneNoneThe people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?Jesus answered and said unto them, NoneNoneNoneThen said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, NoneThen they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.Then said Jesus unto them, NoneThen said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?What In the last day, that great None(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?So there was a division among the people because of him.And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)Doth our law judge They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.And every man went unto his own house.Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.And they which heard When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.Jesus answered and said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneThen said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.Then said Jesus again unto them, Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, And he said unto them, NoneThen said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, NoneThey understood not that he spake to them of the Father.Then said Jesus unto them, NoneAs he spake these words, many believed on him.Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, NoneThey answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Jesus answered them, NoneNoneNoneNoneThey answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, NoneNoneJesus said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThen answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?Jesus answered, NoneNoneThen said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?Jesus answered, NoneNoneThen said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?Jesus said unto them, Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.And as And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?Jesus answered, NoneNoneWhen he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,And said unto him, The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?Some said, This is he: others Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.These Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.We know that God spake unto Moses: The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?And Jesus said unto him, And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.And Jesus said, And Jesus said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThis parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.Then said Jesus unto them again, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThere was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.Jesus answered them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThen the Jews took up stones again to stone him.Jesus answered them, The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.Jesus answered them, NoneNoneNoneNoneTherefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.And many believed on him there.Now a certain (It was Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.When Jesus heard Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.Then after that saith he to NoneJesus answered, NoneThese things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.Then said Jesus unto them plainly, NoneThen said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.Then when Jesus came, he found that he had Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give Jesus saith unto her, Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.Jesus said unto her, NoneShe saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.As soon as she heard Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,And said, Jesus wept.Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.Jesus said, Jesus saith unto her, Then they took away the stone NoneAnd when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.If we let him thus alone, all And one of them, Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.Then said Jesus, NoneMuch people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.And Jesus answered them, saying, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThe people therefore, that stood by, and heard Jesus answered and said, NoneNoneThis he said, signifying what death he should die.The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, Then Jesus said unto them, NoneBut though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.Jesus cried and said, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNow before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?Jesus answered and said unto him, Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also Jesus saith to him, For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneWhen Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?Jesus answered, And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.For some He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, NoneNoneNoneNoneSimon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.Jesus answered him, NoneNoneNoneNoneThomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?Jesus saith unto him, NonePhilip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.Jesus saith unto him, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneJudas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?Jesus answered and said unto him, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThese things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThen said They said therefore, What is this that he saith, Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneHis disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.Jesus answered them, NoneNoneThese words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneWhen Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.Judas then, having received a band Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, As soon then as he had said unto them, Then asked he them again, Jesus answered, That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.Then said Jesus unto Peter, Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.Jesus answered him, NoneAnd when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?Jesus answered him, Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also One of the servants of the high priest, being Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?Jesus answered him, Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?Jesus answered, Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?Jesus answered, And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!But they cried out, Away with Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called Where they crucified him, and two others with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.And Pilate wrote a title, and put This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Then saith he to the disciple, After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.And he that saw For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation The first Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.And he stooping down, Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.Jesus saith unto her, Jesus saith unto her, Jesus saith unto her, Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and Then the same day at evening, being the first And when he had so said, he shewed unto them Then said Jesus to them again, And when he had said this, he breathed on NoneBut Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: Then saith he to Thomas, And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.Jesus saith unto him, And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.Then Jesus saith unto them, And he said unto them, Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.Jesus saith unto them, Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, and hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.Jesus saith unto them, Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, He saith to him again the second time, He saith unto him the third time, NoneThis spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what Jesus saith unto him, Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:And, being assembled together with NoneWhen they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?And he said unto them, NoneAnd when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day’s journey.And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)Men For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God,I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:And it shall come to pass, Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.Men Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,Until I make thy foes thy footstool.Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.Now when they heard Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.And all that believed were together, and had all things common;And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.And he took him by the right hand, and lifted And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.And all the people saw him walking and praising God:And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.And when Peter saw The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.And it shall come to pass, Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.And they laid hands on them, and put Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,And laid And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, Having land, sold But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,And kept back But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid There came also a multitude Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.And when they heard But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.And when they had brought them, they set Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.Then Peter and the The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.Him hath God exalted with his right hand And we are his witnesses of these things; and When they heard Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.Then there arose certain of And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.Then said the high priest, Are these things so?And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.And at the second Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father’s house three months:And when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.And seeing one For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.When Moses saw NoneThen said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.But Solomon built him an house.Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,Heaven Hath not my hand made all these things?Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,And cast And they stoned Stephen, calling upon And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.And devout men carried Stephen As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed And there was great joy in that city.But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)Then laid they And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.And Philip ran thither to And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.And as they went on And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, And the Lord NoneThen Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.But the Lord said unto him, NoneAnd Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.But all that heard But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.Then the disciples took him by night, and let And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.But Barnabas took him, and brought And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.NoneThen had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning And he gave her And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian A devout He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.And now send men to Joppa, and call for He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;And when he had declared all On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.And there came a voice to him, But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.And the voice This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.Then called he them in, and lodged And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.Therefore came I And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.Then Peter opened But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.The word which That word, How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.But Peter rehearsed I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.And I heard a voice saying unto me, But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.But the voice answered me again from heaven, And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.And the spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house:And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)And when he had apprehended him, he put Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and And when he had considered And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king’s And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.And the people gave a shout, And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.But the word of God grew and multiplied.And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.Then Saul, (who also And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, And now, behold, the hand of the Lord Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.And after that he gave And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the Of this man’s seed hath God according to When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not Men For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled And though they found no cause of death And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took But God raised him from the dead:And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, Wherefore he saith also in another For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.Be it known unto you therefore, men And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.For so hath the Lord commanded us, And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use They were ware of And there they preached the gospel.And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked:The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.NoneAnd saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.And there came thither Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and Confirming the souls of the disciples, And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.And there they abode long time with the disciples.And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; And they wrote Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:NoneAnd Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed And after they had tarried Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed.And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.And they came and besought them, and brought And they went out of the prison, and entered into Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device.And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this So Paul departed from among them.Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook And he departed thence, and entered into a certain And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, NoneAnd he continued And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,Saying, This And when Paul was now about to open But if it be a question of words and names, and And he drave them from the judgment seat.Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat And Paul And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.When they desired But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.And after he had spent some time And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:For he mightily convinced the Jews, And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism.Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.When they heard And when Paul had laid And all the men were about twelve.And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.And there were seven sons of And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.For a certain Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.And when they heard And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,And And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.These going before tarried for us at Troas.And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.And upon the first And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.And we sailed thence, and came the next For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:NoneTestifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.And when we had finished And the next And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.And as we tarried And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.There went with us also And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.And the And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.And when they heard And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?But Paul said, I am a man And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)I am verily a man And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;And saw him saying unto me, And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.And he said unto me, And they gave him audience unto this word, and And as they cried out, and cast off The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?When the centurion heard Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.And there arose a great cry: and the scribes And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.Then Paul called one of the centurions unto So he took him, and brought Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.So the chief captain And he called unto And provide And he wrote a letter after this manner:Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.And when the governor had read I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s judgment hall.And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse We accept Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.For we have found this man Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.But the chief captain Lysias came Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.Or else let these same Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul was brought forth.And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:Especially My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:Unto which Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, NoneNoneNoneWhereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:That Christ should suffer, And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; And the next And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next And the third And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;And sounded, and found Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.And while the day was coming on, Paul besought Wherefore I pray you to take And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from And the rest, some on boards, and some on And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid And when the barbarians saw the And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.And landing at Syracuse, we tarried And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men Who, when they had examined me, would have let But when the Jews spake against For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;And declared By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, Because that, when they knew God, they glorified Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.And even as they did not like to retain God in Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;Who will render to every man according to his deeds:To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:For there is no respect of persons with God.For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;(For not the hearers of the law For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,And knowest And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither But he What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?And not What then? are we better As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.Their throat Whose mouth Their feet Destruction and misery And the way of peace have they not known:There is no fear of God before their eyes.Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;Even the righteousness of God For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:Whom God hath set forth To declare, Where Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.NoneSeeing Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,NoneBlessed NoneHow was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, For if they which are of the law Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, Therefore (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb:He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.And not only And patience, experience; and experience, hope:And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.And not only Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.But not as the offence, so also And not as For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)Therefore as by the offence of one For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with For he that is dead is freed from sin.Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.Neither yield ye your members For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.For the wages of sin Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to So then if, while Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not What shall we say then? But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.And the commandment, which For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew Wherefore the law Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.NoneFor the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.For to be carnally minded Because the carnal mind So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.And if Christ But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.And not only For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?But if we hope for that we see not, Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.What shall we then say to these things? If God He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? Who Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:Who are Israelites; to whom Whose Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these For this And not only (For It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.What shall we say then? For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.So then For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?NoneAnd that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.And it shall come to pass, Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:For he will finish the work, and cut And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.Wherefore? Because As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.For Christ For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?So then faith But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.And if by grace, then What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but Now if the fall of them For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:If by any means I may provoke to emulation For if the casting away of them For if the firstfruit And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:For if God spared not the natural branches, Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:For this As concerning the gospel, For the gifts and calling of God For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?For of him, and through him, and to him, I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:So we, Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, Or ministry, Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, NoneNoneNot slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.NoneRecompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to Wherefore For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love And that, knowing the time, that now The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day He that regardeth the day, regardeth For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.For it is written, So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that But if thy brother be grieved with Let not then your good be evil spoken of:For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.For he that in these things serveth Christ Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed NoneHast thou faith? have And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.Let every one of us please For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:That ye may with one mind Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises And that the Gentiles might glorify God for And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation:But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.Now the God of peace I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.Likewise Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus’ Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.For your obedience is come abroad unto all And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.I Tertius, who wrote Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:Paul, called Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called Grace I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:Who shall also confirm you unto the end, God Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.Where For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, That no flesh should glory in his presence.But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.And my speech and my preaching That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.But God hath revealed For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able For ye are yet carnal: for whereas For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I Who then is Paul, and who I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;And ye are Christ’s; and Christ Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and For who maketh thee to differ Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.We Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.For the kingdom of God What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and It is reported commonly And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.Your glorying Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: Nevertheless, Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.Defraud ye not one the other, except But I speak this by permission, For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.And unto the married I command, But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.Art thou called For he that is called in the Lord, Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.But this I say, brethren, the time And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;And they that use this world, as not abusing But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please There is difference And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.So then he that giveth The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.But if any man love God, the same is known of him.As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)But to us Howbeit But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,Have we not power to eat and to drink?Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?Or saith he If we have sown unto you spiritual things, If others be partakers of Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation What is my reward then? For though I be free from all And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:But I keep under my body, and bring Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;And did all eat the same spiritual meat;And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.Neither be ye idolaters, as Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?For we Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?But Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, For the earth If any of them that believe not bid you But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:Even as I please all Be ye followers of me, even as I also Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman Every man praying or prophesying, having But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.For a man indeed ought not to cover For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.For this cause ought the woman to have power on Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.For as the woman Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.Now in this that I declare For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.When ye come together therefore into one place, For in eating every one taketh before What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the And when he had given thanks, he brake After the same manner also For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.For this cause many For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.Now concerning spiritual Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether For the body is not one member, but many.If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?If the whole body But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.And if they were all one member, where But now And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:And those For our comely That there should be no schism in the body; but And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.NoneHave all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become And though I have And though I bestow all my goods to feed Charity suffereth long, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.Charity never faileth: but whether For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these Follow after charity, and desire spiritual For he that speaketh in an But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men He that speaketh in an I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual Wherefore let him that speaketh in an For if I pray in an What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.In the law it is written, With Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.If any man speak in an But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.If For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.For God is not Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.Let all things be done decently and in order.Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace Therefore whether Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:And if Christ be not risen, then Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:And if Christ be not raised, your faith Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.But now is Christ risen from the dead, For since by man For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.Then For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.The last enemy For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak But some NoneAnd that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.All flesh NoneNoneSo also It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam Howbeit that The first man As And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.O death, where The sting of death But thanks Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.Upon the first And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.As touching Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.Let all your things be done with charity.I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.The salutation of If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and Blessed Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.And whether we be afflicted, And our hope of you For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?But For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, For all the promises of God in him Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which So that contrariwise ye Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.To whom ye forgive any thing, I Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.Furthermore, when I came to Troas to I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.Now thanks For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:To the one For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:NoneAnd such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.But if the ministration of death, written How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?For if the ministration of condemnation For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.For if that which is done away Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:And not as Moses, But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.NonePersecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.So then death worketh in us, but life in you.We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present For all things For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen For we know that if our earthly house of For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.For we that are in Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing Therefore (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)We are confident, Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to For whether we be beside ourselves, For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:And Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Therefore if any man And all things To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech For he hath made him We then, (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:But in all In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and As unknown, and As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and O Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.I speak not Great For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.For to Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and And Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.Therefore, as ye abound in every I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.And herein I give Now therefore perform the doing For if there be first a willing mind, For But by an equality, As it is written, He that But thanks For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;And not Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which Whether Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as But this Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, And God (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection into the gospel of Christ, and for And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.Thanks Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence But I beseech For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:(For the weapons of our warfare Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.For Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.But we will not boast of things without For we stretch not ourselves beyond Not boasting of things without To preach the gospel in the But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.Would to God ye could bear with me a little in For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.But though Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?I robbed other churches, taking wages And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.For such And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.Therefore I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.That which I speak, I speak Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.Are they Hebrews? so Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I Of the Jews five times received I forty Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;NoneIn weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.And he said unto me, Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?I desired Titus, and with Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and NoneThis I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.Greet one another with an holy kiss.All the saints salute you.Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:Grace Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:To whom I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.As we said before, so say I now again, If any For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.And they glorified God in me.Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they who seemed But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we Only But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before We Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.And this I say, For if the inheritance Wherefore then Now a mediator is not NoneBut the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.And if ye Now I say, But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.Brethren, I beseech you, be as I Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?They zealously affect you, But My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.But he Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.For it is written, Rejoice, Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?This persuasion A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.I would they were even cut off which trouble you.For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only For all the law is fulfilled in one word, But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.NoneFor the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.For every man shall bear his own burden.Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.And as many as walk according to this rule, peace From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:Grace Blessed According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.In whom ye also Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,And what Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:And hath put all Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.And you Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)And hath raised That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: Not of works, lest any man should boast.For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.Wherefore remember, that ye That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to youward:How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;And to make all To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,May be able to comprehend with all saints what And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,Unto him I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.NoneOne Lord, one faith, one baptism,One God and Father of all, who But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:That we But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.But ye have not so learned Christ;If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:Neither give place to the devil.Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.Be not ye therefore partakers with them.For ye were sometimes darkness, but now (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.Servants, be obedient to them that are Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.But that ye also may know my affairs, Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and Peace Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:Grace I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,According to my earnest expectation and For to me to live But if I live in the flesh, this For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:Nevertheless to abide in the flesh And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear If Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, NoneLook not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of And Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of Do all things without murmurings and disputings:That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.Yea doubtless, and I count all things And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, Whose end For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and Rejoice in the Lord alway: Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.Now unto God and our Father Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s household.Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;Which is come unto you, as As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.For this cause we also, since the day we heard That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated In whom we have redemption through his blood, Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all For it pleased And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church:Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;NoneTo whom God would make known what Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;NoneLet no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,(Touch not; taste not; handle not;Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.When Christ, Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;And have put on the new Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also And above all these things And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.Husbands, love Children, obey Fathers, provoke not your children Servants, obey in all things And whatsoever ye do, do Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.Masters, give unto Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.Let your speech All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister’s son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only Epaphras, who is For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.For our exhortation But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.Ye As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.For what For ye are our glory and joy.Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.For this is the will of God, That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:That no For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:Then we which are alive Wherefore comfort one another with these words.But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.Therefore let us not sleep, as For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all See that none render evil for evil unto any Rejoice evermore.Pray without ceasing.In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.Quench not the Spirit.Despise not prophesyings.Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.Abstain from all appearance of evil.And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and Faithful Brethren, pray for us.Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:NoneSeeing And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.Let no man deceive you by any means: for Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:NoneAnd with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.Yet count Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, Unto Timothy, As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.But we know that the law Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.This Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, For kings, and For this Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.For Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.For Adam was first formed, then Eve.And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.This A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.Likewise Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being Even so Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;Forbidding to marry, For every creature of God For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.This For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.These things command and teach.Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.Rebuke not an elder, but intreat The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.Honour widows that are widows indeed.But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.And withal they learn I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.For some are already turned aside after Satan.If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.I charge Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some Likewise also the good works Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and And they that have believing masters, let them not despise If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.But godliness with contentment is great gain.For we brought nothing into And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and That thou keep Which in his times he shall shew, Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,To Timothy, I thank God, whom I serve from Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;Who hath saved us, and called But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of And if a man also strive for masteries, The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.NoneIf we suffer, we shall also reign with If we believe not, Of these things put Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.But shun profane And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;And This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.All scripture That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.I charge Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;And they shall turn away But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.I have fought a good fight, I have finished Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.At my first answer no man stood with me, but all Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;To Titus, For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.One of themselves, This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.Unto the pure all things They profess that they know God; but in works they deny But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.The aged women likewise, that That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,NoneYoung men likewise exhort to be sober minded.In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.NoneNot purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.NoneBut avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,And to Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.If he hath wronged thee, or oweth I Paul have written Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,Hath in these last days spoken unto us by Who being the brightness of Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.But unto the Son Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.But to which of the angels said he at any times, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard God also bearing For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.For it became him, for whom For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.For verily he took not on Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses For this For every house is builded by some And Moses verily But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.But with whom was he grieved forty years? And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.For he spake in a certain place of the seventh And in this Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.For the word of God Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.As he saith also in another Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which For every one that useth milk But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.And this will we do, if God permit.For And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:But that which beareth thorns and briers But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.For God And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed That by two immutable things, in which Which Whither the forerunner is for us entered, For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.Now consider how great this man And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.And here men that die receive tithes; but there he And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.For And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.For he testifieth, Thou For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope And inasmuch as not without an oath (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:But this Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.For such an high priest became us, Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, Now of the things which we have spoken A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.For if that first For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.For this And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.In that he saith, A new Then verily the first For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service But into the second The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:Which NoneBut Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions For where a testament For a testament Whereupon neither the first For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,Saying, This Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.NoneFor Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.For the law having a shadow of good things to come, For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.But in those For Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:In burnt offerings and Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.NoneThis And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.Now where remission of these Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;And Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.Let us hold fast the profession of And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?For we know him that hath said, Vengeance NoneBut call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.Now the just shall live by faith: but if But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.For by it the elders obtained a good report.Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.But without faith By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.And truly, if they had been mindful of that But now they desire a better By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:Accounting that God By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:And others had trial of They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected For they verily for a few days chastened Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.Follow peace with all Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble Lest there For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:And so terrible was the sight, But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.And this Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:For our God Let brotherly love continue.Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; Marriage NoneSo that we may boldly say, The Lord Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.But I beseech Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.Know ye that Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;Knowing But let patience have If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.A double minded man Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.Blessed Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.Do not err, my beloved brethren.Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.What If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.Behold also the ships, which though Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!And the tongue For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:But the tongue can no man tame; Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so Who But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.This wisdom descendeth not from above, but For where envying and strife But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.From whence Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:Whereas ye know not what For that ye But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth Go to now, Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.Ye have condemned Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.Confess Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.Blessed To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see Receiving the end of your faith, Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.For all flesh But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:If so be ye have tasted that the Lord To whom coming, Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.Unto you therefore which believe And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, But ye Which in time past Dearly beloved, I beseech Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:As free, and not using Honour all Servants, For this For what glory For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.Likewise, ye wives, While they behold your chaste conversation Whose adorning let it not be that outward But For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with Finally, Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.For the eyes of the Lord And who But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.For For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.The like figure whereunto Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;That he no longer should live the rest of For the time past of Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.Use hospitality one to another without grudging.As every man hath received the gift, If any man speak, Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or Yet if For the time And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight Neither as being lords over And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle To him By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.The Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.For if these things be in you, and abound, they make But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting Knowing that shortly I must put off Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man’s voice forbad the madness of the prophet.These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.For when they speak great swelling While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.NoneLooking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.And account As also in all Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;(For the life was manifested, and we have seen That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him Love not the world, neither the things For all that And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.And this is the promise that he hath promised us, These But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.Not as Cain, Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.Hereby perceive we the love But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.We love him, because he first loved us.If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?This is he that came by water and blood, For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.He that hath the Son hath life; These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.If any man see his brother sin a sin All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.NoneThe elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;For the truth’s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.Grace be with you, mercy, I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.Having many things to write unto you, I would not The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:Because that for his name’s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.Demetrius hath good report of all I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.Likewise also these Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.And of some have compassion, making a difference:And others save with fear, pulling Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.Blessed John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace And from Jesus Christ, And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they NoneI John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,Saying, And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;And in the midst of the seven candlesticks His head and And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAfter this I looked, and, behold, a door And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and And round about the throne And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and And before the throne And the first beast And the four beasts had each of them six wings about And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.And there went out another horse And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.And I heard the number of them which were sealed: Of the tribe of Juda Of the tribe of Aser Of the tribe of Simeon Of the tribe of Zabulon After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.And all the angels stood round about the throne, and Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer And the smoke of the incense, And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.And the shapes of the locusts And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power And they had a king over them, One woe is past; And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.And the number of the army of the horsemen And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and And cried with a loud voice, as And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty And I will give These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.And their dead bodies And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.The second woe is past; And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.Therefore rejoice, And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.If any man have an ear, let him hear.He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.Here is the patience of the saints: here And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, NoneAnd he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:And upon her forehead And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.And here And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.Rejoice over her, And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:For true and righteous And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him His eyes And he And the armies And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.And he hath on And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This Blessed and holy And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,Having the glory of God: and her light And had a wall great and high, On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred And the building of the wall of it was And the foundations of the wall of the city The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.And the twelve gates And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:And they shall see his face; and his name And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.And he said unto me, These sayings NoneAnd I John saw these things, and heard Then saith he unto me, See And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.NoneNoneBlessed For without NoneAnd the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and He which testifieth these things saith,
